Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to improve your overall efficiency with your computer, but they can be difficult to commit to memory all at once. This month we will suggest a new shortcut each day that we find helpful in our day-to-day lives as front-end web developers. By learning a new shortcut each day you will be well on your way to living a mouse-free life.

### Preface
I do much of my day-to-day work on a Windows 7 machine using WebStorm, Visual Studio 2013, and Google Docs. As such, this list of keyboard shortcuts may not be as helpful to users of different platforms and software, though there are generally similar shortcuts available on those systems.

#### 6/1 Move windows in Windows
I find the ability to manipulate the position of windows via the keyboard in Windows 7 as one of the greatest features the OS offers - yet many users somehow overlook this simple set of shortcuts. By holding the Windows key and using your keyboard arrow keys you'll no longer need your mouse to move the active window.

Key combination    | Result
------------------ |-----------
`win + left-arrow` | Split left
`win + right-arrow`| Split right
`win + up-arrow`   | Maximize
`win + up-down`    | Minimize

Also, if you have multiple monitors, you can move the window from monitor to monitor by continuing to click the left or right arrow key while holding down the Windows key.

#### 6/2: to be announced...

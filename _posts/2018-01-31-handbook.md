The Base Two Handbook was born on August 26th, 2016. It took another year
and a half to get it to "completion," and now we're ready to share it with the
world.

## Impetus

As we began what would be considered a "hiring spree" for Base Two (we hired 4
people in 2016), it became apparent that as a company, we were throwing
new hires squarely into the deep end. Many of our internal processes and
cultural expectations were scattered around in various Google Drive documents,
if they were written down at all.



- Who
  - base two team
- What
  - codified culture
- where
  - github because we're developers
- when
  - this took a year and a half
  - weekly work sessions, when folks had time
- why
  - keep ourselves honest
  - be able to have structured conversations about company policy
  - as a handout for potential hires (we're not a normal company)
  - a bit of an advertisement
  - reinit the repo to hide our sensitive links, but all updates will be public

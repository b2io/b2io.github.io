[Circle CI](http://circleci.com) is an awesome, affordable continuous integration solution. I am currently using it in a Angular + Rails project, scaffolded with Yeoman, following a workflow similar to [this](http://jeff.konowit.ch/posts/yeoman-rails-angular/).
Here's the problem I ran into: Circle was automatically recognizing and running my rspec tests, but not my angular app's (located at rails_root/angular) karma tests.

###Circle.yml

Boom. The npm/bower package management is a little time-consuming, but this runs both my rspec and karma tests.

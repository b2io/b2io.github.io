In my [first blog post](http://base2.io/2017/01/03/apprenticeship-month-1/) I mentioned that Base Two provided me with a MacBook Pro as part of the [apprenticeship program](http://base2.io/2016/12/21/the-base-two-apprenticeship/). Previously I had been running Ubuntu 16.04, and so I've had to learn the Mac way of doing things.

If you're on a Mac, you're likely to be familiar with how I set things up. But if you're new to developing on a Mac, you'll find this guide helpful.

<!-- #REST#BEGIN -->

1. iTerm2
2. Oh My Zsh
3. Homebrew
4. Python && Python3
5. iPython && iPython3
6. Atom
7. Itsycal
8. Shortcut to open terminal window

----

### 1. iTerm2

Mac users seem to use this instead of the default Terminal. I installed it, and I haven't found a reason not to use it.

I like that it makes the background black without me having to mess with `.bashrc` (though #2 will take care of that anyways).

It loads a little more slowly than Ubuntu's terminal, but it comes with extra features. For example, when there is a URL or directory path printed in the terminal, hold `Cmd` to render it as a clickable hyperlink.

You can set a default window arrangement, including number of windows, their positions, font size, etc. Refer to this [StackOverflow answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/98348/210089?stw=2).

##### Install
<https://www.iterm2.com/>

----

### 2. Oh My Zsh

I used this on Ubuntu also. It's a zsh configuration, and it's the only reason I'm using zsh instead of bash. I don't really take advantage of the [differences between the two](http://stackabuse.com/zsh-vs-bash/).

I like the default theme, and especially how it handles Git repos. It provides *excellent* tab-completion upgrades. For example, tab-complete is case insensitive, and it also searches for available CLI arguments.

Most of all, I like that I can rely on it out of the box. I value the freedom to wipe and reinstall without much overhead.

##### Install
MacOS comes with `zsh` and `curl` already installed. To get Oh My Zsh set up, run the curl command found here: <br/><https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#via-curl>

**Note:** zsh has its own config files. <br/>
`~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bashrc` <br/>
`~/.zprofile` instead of `~/.profile`

----

### 3. Homebrew

This is a package manager like Ubuntu's `apt` and `apt-get`. Commands I use:

```
brew update           # Update Homebrew and its formulae from the main repository
brew install <package>
brew uninstall <package>
brew upgrade <package>
brew outdated         # List all outdated packages
brew upgrade          # Upgrade all outdated packages to their newest versions
brew pin <package>    # Pin package at its current version, preventing upgrade
brew list             # Show all packages installed with Homebrew
```

##### Tips

- Run `brew update` before using Homebrew as good practice.
- After running `brew upgrade`, if a package isn't working, run `brew uninstall <package>` and then re-install it, `brew install <package>`

##### Install
<http://brew.sh/>

----

### 4. Python && Python3

Mac comes with a system version of Python, but it's better to leave that be. Instead, use these new installations for your work. (It took me too long to learn this.)

##### Install

Using Homebrew:

```
brew install python python3
```

**Note:** This also installs `pip` and `pip3` (Python's package manager)

----

### 5. iPython && iPython3

![iPython](http://i.imgur.com/fYgg41c.gif)

If you aren't familiar with iPython I strongly recommend you try it out. As a Python REPL, it gives you a score of features over the plain interpreter.

It has syntax highlighting and tab-completion. It auto-indents your blocks as you type (functions, loops, etc). You can pull your code from the clipboard into the REPL with `%paste`, one of iPython's [magic functions](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html). (It even ignores '+' and '>' characters for pasting from diff files or the basic interpreter.)

I could go on. It's extremely powerful. If you play around in the Python REPL ever, use iPython instead.

##### Install

Using pip:

```
pip install ipython && pip3 install ipython
```

**Note:**

I found that `ipython` was running Python3. Test your installations:

- Run `ipython` to ensure it runs on Python2
- Run `ipython3` to ensure it runs on Python3

If `ipython` runs on Python3:

1. In one terminal, run `where python2`
2. In another terminal, run `where ipython`, and open the output in a text editor
3. Change the first line of the file from (2) to point to the output of (1).

Example (the specific outputs are apt to change):

```bash
where python2  # (1)
# /usr/local/bin/python2
where ipython  # (2)
# /usr/local/bin/ipython
atom /usr/local/bin/ipython  # (3)
```

The first line might look like this:

```
#!/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6
```

Change it to point to (1):

```
#!/usr/local/bin/python2
```

While you're at it, I recommend doing the same for `where ipython3`. It's possible that it currently points to a specific version of Python 3.x. I like to change it to point to the output of `where python3`, in order to use the newest version of Python3 installed.

----

### 6. Atom

I used Sublime previously, and it has things that Atom doesn't have yet. That said, the team uses Atom, so I'm going to stick with it for consistency.

It has a nice CLI package manager that works like Node's, for example:

```
apm install linter
apm uninstall linter
apm ls
```

Atom was installed when I got the Mac, so there might have been some setup I'm not aware of. These are the community packages I have installed:

- highlight-selected
- linter
- linter-eslint
- linter-stylelint
- pretty-json
- react

##### Install
<https://atom.io/>

----

### 7. Itsycal

![Itsycal](http://i.imgur.com/oTC5hlG.png)

This is a mini-calendar for the menu bar. I didn't realize how often I used Ubuntu's until it was gone.

##### Install
<https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/>

**Note:** To move menu bar icons around, hold the `Cmd` key, then click and drag the icon.

----

### 8. Shortcut to open terminal window

When I first got the Mac, I really missed the Ubuntu shortcut for opening a Terminal. I followed the steps in [this Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35954184/is-there-any-shortcut-keyboard-method-to-open-terminal-in-macos) to set one up, but unfortunately it doesn't work reliably.

Now I keep iTerm on the Dock for easy access, and press `Cmd+N` to open new windows from it.

There is also Spotlight, similar to Ubuntu's Launcher. Press `Cmd+Space` to bring up its search bar.

          At the heart of the experiences we make are the humans we make them
          for, and behind Base Two is an experienced team of people who are
          always up for a challenge. Here&rsquo;s a little more about our
          guiding principles:
        </Text>
      </div>
      <IconCard icon="transparency" heading="Transparency">
        The best working relationships are built on trust and transparency. So
        we communicate clearly and honestly&mdash;no jargon here. Only by being
        straightforward and honest can we get to the beautiful result weâ€™re all
        driving toward.
      </IconCard>
      <IconCard icon="sustainability" heading="Sustainability">
        Our software is engineered for the long haul. Yes, we&rsquo;re going to
        meet today&rsquo;s spec. But we also build flexibility into every piece
        we ship. Through rigorous attention to detail and intentionality in
        every decision, Base Two creates lasting value.
      </IconCard>
      <IconCard icon="empathy" heading="Empathy">
        Empathy shines through in everything we do at Base Two&mdash;from
        relationships with clients to friendships with one another. By always
        keeping the user front and center, we create software that people
        actually enjoy using.
      </IconCard>
      <IconCard icon="community" heading="Community">
        We love to share what we&rsquo;ve learned with others. Whether
        it&rsquo;s giving a talk at a local event or training teams on the
        latest technology, teaching others is a core part of what we do.

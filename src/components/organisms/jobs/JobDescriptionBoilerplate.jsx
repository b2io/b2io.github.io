        <H2>About Base Two</H2>
        <P>
          Base Two is a multi-city company of experienced developers working
          together to turn ideas into beautiful software. We work as individuals
          and teams with small and large companies — local and abroad — to
          improve processes around software development and deliver user-focused
          products and applications.
        </P>
        <P>
          We strive to be a forward-thinking and constantly improving collection
          of knowledgeable individuals. We work together to exceed what we could
          do alone. Openness, honesty, and empathy are the building blocks of
          our culture.

        <H2>Our Interview Process</H2>
        <P>
          After reviewing resumes, portfolios and any other material submitted
          with an application, we schedule a Small Team Interview with the
          candidates we are interested in meeting. In this meeting, two members
          of Base Two meet with a candidate either in person or via a video
          call. The goal of the Small Team Interview is to answer any questions
          the candidate has about our company and processes, and learn what the
          candidate is interested in so we can determine if their skillset
          aligns with our present needs. If we think it might be a good fit, we
          schedule a Full Team Interview with the candidate. We strive to
          communicate each candidate’s status with them every step of the way.

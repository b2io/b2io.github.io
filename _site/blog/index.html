  <div class="content">      
    <p>In my <a href="http://base2.io/2017/01/03/apprenticeship-month-1/">first blog post</a> I mentioned that Base Two provided me with a MacBook Pro as part of the <a href="http://base2.io/2016/12/21/the-base-two-apprenticeship/">apprenticeship program</a>. Previously I had been running Ubuntu 16.04, and so I’ve had to learn the Mac way of doing things.</p>

<p>If you’re on a Mac, you’re likely to be familiar with how I set things up. But if you’re new to developing on a Mac, you’ll find this guide helpful.</p>

<h3 id="iterm2">1. iTerm2</h3>

<p>Mac users seem to use this instead of the default Terminal. I installed it, and I haven’t found a reason not to use it.</p>

<p>I like that it makes the background black without me having to mess with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> (though #2 will take care of that anyways).</p>

<p>It loads a little more slowly than Ubuntu’s terminal, but it comes with extra features. For example, when there is a URL or directory path printed in the terminal, hold <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd</code> to render it as a clickable hyperlink.</p>

<p>You can set a default window arrangement, including number of windows, their positions, font size, etc. Refer to this <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/98348/210089?stw=2">StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>

<h5 id="install">Install</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">https://www.iterm2.com/</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="oh-my-zsh">2. Oh My Zsh</h3>

<p>I used this on Ubuntu also. It’s a zsh configuration, and it’s the only reason I’m using zsh instead of bash. I don’t really take advantage of the <a href="http://stackabuse.com/zsh-vs-bash/">differences between the two</a>.</p>

<p>I like the default theme, and especially how it handles Git repos. It provides <em>excellent</em> tab-completion upgrades. For example, tab-complete is case insensitive, and it also searches for available CLI arguments.</p>

<p>Most of all, I like that I can rely on it out of the box. I value the freedom to wipe and reinstall without much overhead.</p>

<h5 id="install-1">Install</h5>
<p>MacOS comes with <code class="highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> already installed. To get Oh My Zsh set up, run the curl command found here: <br /><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#via-curl">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#via-curl</a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> zsh has its own config files. <br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.zshrc</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code> <br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.zprofile</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.profile</code></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="homebrew">3. Homebrew</h3>

<p>This is a package manager like Ubuntu’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get</code>. Commands I use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew update           # Update Homebrew and its formulae from the main repository
brew install &lt;package&gt;
brew uninstall &lt;package&gt;
brew upgrade &lt;package&gt;
brew outdated         # List all outdated packages
brew upgrade          # Upgrade all outdated packages to their newest versions
brew pin &lt;package&gt;    # Pin package at its current version, preventing upgrade
brew list             # Show all packages installed with Homebrew
</code></pre>
</div>

<h5 id="tips">Tips</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew update</code> before using Homebrew as good practice.</li>
  <li>After running <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew upgrade</code>, if a package isn’t working, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew uninstall &lt;package&gt;</code> and then re-install it, <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install &lt;package&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="python--python3">4. Python &amp;&amp; Python3</h3>

<p>Mac comes with a system version of Python, but it’s better to leave that be. Instead, use these new installations for your work. (It took me too long to learn this.)</p>

<h5 id="install-3">Install</h5>

<p>Using Homebrew:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install python python3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This also installs <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip3</code> (Python’s package manager)</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ipython--ipython3">5. iPython &amp;&amp; iPython3</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fYgg41c.gif" alt="iPython" /></p>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with iPython I strongly recommend you try it out. As a Python REPL, it gives you a score of features over the plain interpreter.</p>

<p>It has syntax highlighting and tab-completion. It auto-indents your blocks as you type (functions, loops, etc). You can pull your code from the clipboard into the REPL with <code class="highlighter-rouge">%paste</code>, one of iPython’s <a href="https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html">magic functions</a>. (It even ignores ‘+’ and ‘&gt;’ characters for pasting from diff files or the basic interpreter.)</p>

<p>I could go on. It’s extremely powerful. If you play around in the Python REPL ever, use iPython instead.</p>

<h5 id="install-4">Install</h5>

<p>Using pip:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install ipython &amp;&amp; pip3 install ipython
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>I found that <code class="highlighter-rouge">ipython</code> was running Python3. Test your installations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ipython</code> to ensure it runs on Python2</li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ipython3</code> to ensure it runs on Python3</li>
</ul>

<p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">ipython</code> runs on Python3:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In one terminal, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">where python2</code></li>
  <li>In another terminal, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">where ipython</code>, and open the output in a text editor</li>
  <li>Change the first line of the file from (2) to point to the output of (1).</li>
</ol>

<p>Example (the specific outputs are apt to change):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>where python2  <span class="c"># (1)</span>
<span class="c"># /usr/local/bin/python2</span>
where ipython  <span class="c"># (2)</span>
<span class="c"># /usr/local/bin/ipython</span>
atom /usr/local/bin/ipython  <span class="c"># (3)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first line might look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Change it to point to (1):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/usr/local/bin/python2</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While you’re at it, I recommend doing the same for <code class="highlighter-rouge">where ipython3</code>. It’s possible that it currently points to a specific version of Python 3.x. I like to change it to point to the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">where python3</code>, in order to use the newest version of Python3 installed.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="atom">6. Atom</h3>

<p>I used Sublime previously, and it has things that Atom doesn’t have yet. That said, the team uses Atom, so I’m going to stick with it for consistency.</p>

<p>It has a nice CLI package manager that works like Node’s, for example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>apm install linter
apm uninstall linter
apm ls
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Atom was installed when I got the Mac, so there might have been some setup I’m not aware of. These are the community packages I have installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highlight-selected</li>
  <li>linter</li>
  <li>linter-eslint</li>
  <li>linter-stylelint</li>
  <li>pretty-json</li>
  <li>react</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="install-5">Install</h5>

<hr />

<h3 id="itsycal">7. Itsycal</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oTC5hlG.png" alt="Itsycal" /></p>

<p>This is a mini-calendar for the menu bar. I didn’t realize how often I used Ubuntu’s until it was gone.</p>

<h5 id="install-6">Install</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/">https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/</a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To move menu bar icons around, hold the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd</code> key, then click and drag the icon.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="shortcut-to-open-terminal-window">8. Shortcut to open terminal window</h3>

<p>When I first got the Mac, I really missed the Ubuntu shortcut for opening a Terminal. I followed the steps in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35954184/is-there-any-shortcut-keyboard-method-to-open-terminal-in-macos">this Stack Overflow answer</a> to set one up, but unfortunately it doesn’t work reliably.</p>

<p>Now I keep iTerm on the Dock for easy access, and press <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd+N</code> to open new windows from it.</p>

<p>There is also Spotlight, similar to Ubuntu’s Launcher. Press <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd+Space</code> to bring up its search bar.</p>

  </h2>
  <div class="content">      
    <p>When I started this apprenticeship with Base Two, we knew it would be an experiment for all of us. We’ve tried different things. I’ve worked on projects of different scope and size, with different team members, and had a chance to reflect on how things have gone so far.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll briefly review Month One.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Base Two provided me with a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) and a monitor. Previously I was on Ubuntu, so I had to put in some work getting up and running on the Mac. I’m putting together a concise blog post showing my set up.</p>

<p><a href="http://base2.io/#team">Tony</a> is my main point of contact during this apprenticeship. We both work remotely from our homes in Pittsburgh, and regularly touch base through video chatting. We occasionally meet up in-person, and on my first day I went to his home office, where he helped me get started on my first project.</p>

<h3 id="project-1">Project 1</h3>

<p>The first project I worked on was a marketing page. It was a smaller project, with most of the components and styles in place by the time I joined. Components were built using React, and my first task was to add data flow.</p>

<p>Prior to the apprenticeship I had built out two small web-apps using React and Redux, and I was comfortable with the basic concepts and implementations of the Redux flow. In my personal projects, however, I’d never received feedback on my designs and decisions. I knew how I had done things in the past, but I didn’t have any perspective to give me confidence.</p>

<p>Tony was dedicated to a different project, and hadn’t done a lot of work in React or Redux, but he still talked through ideas with me, offered advice, and reviewed my code. After deciding to use Redux, he encouraged me to talk through what I would need to do, which helped us create issues in the backlog.</p>

<p><a href="http://base2.io/#team">Chris</a>, one of Base Two’s UX Developers, had been on the project from the start, and I treated him as project lead. I checked in with him, talked over requirements, and we paired on some tasks together.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AxDbeSq.png" alt="Project 1" title="Project 1 screenshot" /></p>

<p>We had a particularly good pairing session working on the sliders you can see in the photo. Screen sharing, I showed him how I was using Redux to handle the data, and to track which sliders should be enabled or disabled. After we got that working, he took over and styled the sliders accordingly. It was super productive and fun.</p>

<p>Because neither Chris nor Tony had worked much with Redux, I needed someone to review how I was using Redux, and to call out where I could do things better.</p>

<p>Drew came through big league for me in reviewing my PRs. He read through the majority of my code, and gave me valuable feedback on better ways to structure the app. He called attention to some performance tradeoffs, and gave me advice on designing and shaping the Redux store.</p>

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Month One is that Tony and Chris, my two main points of contact this month, could only give me so much guidance. This meant that I spent some time doing things incorrectly until Drew was able to step in. There are also things that Drew might have had me do differently, had we been working together from the start, but which went unsaid or unnoticed because he was only available part of the time.</p>

<p>The perfectionist in me wishes that I had worked more closely with Drew during the first month, but I think his giving me space was for the best. I bumbled through things at times, but it gave him a body of code to review and work with me on, rather than just answering each of my questions as they arose.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, it forced me to not give in to my desire to nitpick and doubt everything I’ve done. I had to keep moving forward despite doubting myself and my decisions. I see this as an important skill that I need to practice.</p>

<p>Things went better this month than I could have imagined. I had a lot of fun coding, researching, and learning. I get to use all of these tools in Month Two as I start on the largest project I’ve ever worked on.</p>

    <p>Back in August the entire Base Two team attended the <a href="http://abstractions.io" target="blank">Abstractions conference</a> in Pittsburgh. Between the seven of us, we attended a ton of different sessions. One particular standout was <a href="https://twitter.com/rustbeltrachel/">Rachel Krantz</a>’s <a href="https://t.co/qRxOizjqoG">presentation on apprenticeships</a>. We had discussed starting an apprenticeship program at Base Two in the past, and Rachel’s talk finally got the ball rolling.</p>

<!--</p>

<p>We made time for lengthy discussions about how to make our program mutually beneficial to the company and the apprentice, and how to ensure that we stayed true to our culture and values. What shook out were some baseline goals for the program:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expand our internal technical knowledge through teaching</li>
  <li>Stress test and improve our process</li>
  <li>Increase our social footprint (blog posts, social media, networking)</li>
  <li>Offset the apprenticeship costs via internal or billable work</li>
  <li>Pay the apprentice fairly for their time</li>
  <li>Give the apprentice full visibility into our processes including operations and decision-making</li>
  <li>Provide the apprentice the experience and confidence necessary to be hired after the apprenticeship either by Base Two or by another company</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these goals, and our company culture, we arrived at the following structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 month employment duration</li>
  <li>A total of $10,000 in compensation</li>
  <li>Scheduled touchpoints throughout the day to answer questions and discuss status</li>
  <li>Weekly co-working</li>
  <li>Shadow each person on the team at least once</li>
  <li>Inclusion in all Base Two activities (weekly meetings, quarterly meetings, reviews)</li>
  <li>Hardware and software provided by Base Two</li>
  <li>Benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Paid holidays</li>
      <li>Up to 5 days of vacation</li>
      <li>Sick days as necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>A note on compensation:</strong></em> We came up with this number by identifying a current competitive “junior developer” salary ($40,000) in Columbus, Ohio. We calculated three-month’s worth of that, and arrived at $10,000. Our first apprentice was based in Pittsburgh, which has very similar cost-of-living numbers to Columbus. We plan to adjust the initial salary number based on the current local cost-of-living for future apprentices.</p>

<p>We are very excited to have finally started and are now halfway into our very first apprenticeship with <a href="https://github.com/reeddunkle">Reed Dunkle</a>. He has been an excellent guinea pig and has already given us great insight and feedback into how we can improve the program for future apprentices. As with all of our projects, we’ll be iterating and improving this process as we go. Over the next few weeks Reed will be publishing his own blog posts about his experience so far. Stay tuned!

    <p>I have gone to my fair share of tech conferences so far in my career, but now I can say that I’ve been to Nerd Woodstock. Last week was the 10th annual <a href="https://events.google.com/io2016" title="Google I/O 2016">Google I/O</a> which took place at the Shoreline Amphitheatre, near Google’s main campus in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DWAVnDC.jpg" alt="Google I/O 2016 sculpture" title="Google I/O 2016 sculpture" /></p>

<p>The Keynote began with an amazing live <a href="http://williamandtheearthharp.com" title="Earth Harp">Earth Harp</a> performance of a song from the motion picture <em>Amélie</em> followed by a slick video and then dove right into the announcements.</p>

<!--

<iframe width="560" height="315" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 2em;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mp6UsuRteNw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The following were the highlights for me:</p>

<h3 id="google-home">Google Home</h3>

<p>Building on the Big Brother-esque amount of data Google has on the world, and on us as users, they are now able to use natural language processing to respond to voice queries and commands in a conversational tone. They call it the Google Assistant, and they’re integrating it into every product they can, starting with Google Home. Out later this year, the Google Home is a device about the size of a large stemless wine glass that will let you voice-query Google and cast music and video to your speakers, television, and other synced devices. This one was a bit of a non-starter for me since, as a Generation Y techie, my apartment already has more Internet of Things devices than I know what to do with, including my two much-beloved Chromecasts which this device would seek to replace. As for voice-activated search, my phone might as well be permanently affixed to my hand, so that’s not much of a draw for me either. Still, it’ll be interesting to see how well Google Home performs, especially in comparison to the Amazon Echo.</p>

<h3 id="alloduo">Allo/Duo</h3>

<p>I’ve heard a lot of guff along the lines of “oh yes, a new chat app, that’s <em>exactly</em> what we need.” On the surface, I can see where this sentiment comes from. Why not just update GChat and Hangouts with all these new features that they’re dumping into Allo and Duo? Beats me, but here’s my hunch: a rebrand was in order. In my opinion Hangouts and GChat feel musty, and have felt that way since not long after they were released. With the wild and growing popularity of apps like Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, What’s App, Facetime, and even Slack, it is not at all surprising to me that Google wants to re-enter the fray with a fresh start. They’re pulling a lot of the best-loved features from those competitors (Writing on top of photos =&gt; Snapchat. Overuse of emoji =&gt; Slack. Stickers =&gt; Messenger. Minimal interface =&gt; Facetime.) and layering Assistant ecosystem and Knock Knock to give themselves a competitive advantage.</p>

<h3 id="android">Android</h3>

<p>Admittedly, I am not an Android developer nor do I own any Android devices. I took this part of the Keynote as an opportunity to apply more sunscreen. Naturally, I’m pleased to see that Google is lobbying for <a href="http://unicode.org/L2/L2016/16160-emoji-professions.pdf" title="Expanding Emoji Professions: Reducing Gender Inequality">better representation of women in Unicode</a>. I intend to use the “woman working on a laptop” emoji daily, as soon as it is available. And although I’m not an Android user, I was pretty impressed by the Android Instant App initiative and I wonder if/when Apple will follow suit.</p>

<h3 id="web-chrome">Web (Chrome)</h3>

<p>The big focus for all the Web talks at this year’s I/O was on mobile. Speakers threw the “1 billion mobile users” statistic around a lot. They also harped heavily on their concept of Progressive Web Apps, which are essentially adaptive websites with some Android flair thrown in (such as the ability to pin to the home screen, offline capabilities, and access to the notifications API) and their open source project called <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" title="AMP open source project">AMP</a> (Accelerated Mobile Pages).</p>

<h2 id="the-conference">The Conference</h2>

<p>I was a little concerned, upon first receiving my ticket information, about the fact that the bulk of the conference appeared to be taking place in a series of parking lots.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vNDImS6.png" alt="The map I/O provided to attendees showing large parking lots full of buses and lacking shade." title="The map I/O provided to attendees showing large parking lots full of buses and lacking shade." /></p>

<p>Once I arrived I was reassured to find that all the presentations (save the ones in the Amphitheatre) would be given in enormous tents with top-of-the-line AV equipment. They weren’t all domes, and some were much larger, which was good considering the amount of people wanting to get in.</p>

<h3 id="the-lines">The Lines</h3>

<p>Yes, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2016/05/19/google-io-2016-look-not-run-large-event/" title="Google I/O 2016: A look at how not to run a large event">there were long lines</a>, and yes, I did miss most of the sessions I’d hoped to see on Wednesday.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The lines for sessions are insane, but I finally made it into one.

<p>I was impressed, however, by the conference’s agility in fixing the issues by the second day. I was able to get into every presentation I wanted to attend for the rest of the conference, and many of Wednesday’s over-popular presentations were repeated on Friday.</p>

In the meantime, there was no shortage of interactive and cool stuff to keep attendees preoccupied. A portion of the Amphitheatre, which appeared to be a restaurant usually, was repurposed to house the <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/io2016" title="Google Code Labs">Google Code Labs</a>, where developers were invited to sit down at workstations, some complete with Nests and other devices, to hack through hands-on exercises. Googlers roamed the area, answering questions. I, for one, am very proud of the web interface I cobbled together using Polymer and the Nest API.</p>

<p>Further afield – in the parking lots – tent-shaded areas showed off products like Nest, Firebase, a self-driving car, various smart watches, and Android Auto. There were also Android Experiments like a splatter-painting robot, sight-singing phones, and a plotter that drew out single-line portraits of attendees. A <a href="https://www.google.com/loon" title="Project Loon">Project Loon</a> balloon was also on display.</p>

<p>There was even more stuff, but I need to wrap up this blog post eventually, and I haven’t even covered the sessions yet!</p>

<h2 id="the-sessions">The Sessions</h2>

<p>So what about those sessions that people waited full hours to get into? As expected for a conference of this nature, they were all slick and well-prepared. My focus was mainly on the Web, with things like Polymer and Chrome DevTools. Here are my top favorites.</p>

<h4 id="building-for-billions-on-the-web">Building for Billions on the Web</h4>

<h5 id="tal-oppenheimer">Tal Oppenheimer</h5>

<p>With the internet at our fingertips, it can be hard to remember – if not a complete revelation – that the vast majority of internet users are accessing the web on sub-optimal data connections and small devices. Tal Oppenheimer’s research and insight into this subject is eye-opening, and her recommendations are ones I look forward to playing around with.</p>

<h4 id="devtools-in-2016">DevTools in 2016</h4>

<h5 id="chrome-devtools-team">Chrome DevTools Team</h5>

<p>Where do I even start? Breakpoint visualizations, color palettes, theme-building tools… And, my goodness, the animation tools and inspector? I saw a lot of agape mouths and lit-up faces when I looked around at the rest of the attendees. The diff annotations are going to make a heck of a difference in my personal workflow. Sourcemaps that show and edit properties in the context of the variables and mixins where they originate? Yum. That’s only the first 30 minutes, there are more delicious nuggets in this presentation, like Javascript – and Node.js! – debugging. I highly recommend watching the whole thing if this stuff is your jam.</p>

<h4 id="practical-lessons-from-a-year-of-building-web-components">Practical lessons from a year of building web components</h4>

<h5 id="monica-dinculescu">Monica Dinculescu</h5>

<p>With a secondary title like “The Meownica School for Kids Who Want to Web Good and Do Other Things Good Too,” you know this is going to be a wild ride. And it is. Monica delves into the tips and tricks she has learned on the Polymer team, with a healthy smattering of emoji and anti-input-element sass. My tweet summary does it a fair amount of justice:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Test your shit, document your shit, inputs are shit. Do less, be lazy. Don&#39;t slow down the web.

<p>Just go watch the whole thing. You are unlikely to regret it.</p>

<h4 id="mobile-web-state-of-the-union">Mobile Web State of the Union</h4>

<h5 id="chromium-dev-team">Chromium Dev Team</h5>

<p>This presentation covers Google’s new AMP and PWA initiatives. Making our mobile experiences faster and better for our users is something we as developers should already be striving towards. It’s nice to see that Google has our back. For me, the biggest jaw-drop moment in this presentation is the unveiling of the Web Payments API. That is going to be amazing, and I hope that wide acceptance will push other browsers to follow suit.</p>

<h5 id="paul-irish-sam-saccone">Paul Irish, Sam Saccone</h5>

<p>In a conversational, podcast-like presentation format, Paul and Sam take on some real-world performance issues with the Chrome DevTools. They are self-professed performance geeks, and taking even a little bit of knowledge away from this protip-rich talk is likely to improve your performance game. I am both excited and terrified to run these DevTool recordings on my own site.</p>

<p>I use Google Maps and Places on a near-daily basis, so this was an interesting dive into the Places API and how it works.</p>

<h2 id="community-shoutouts">Community Shoutouts</h2>

<p>Although this was the largest Google I/O yet, with roughly 7,000 attendees, tickets were still difficult to come by. I was able to attend due to the joint efforts of <a href="https://www.womentechmakers.com" title="Women Techmakers">Women Techmakers</a> and <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com" title="Girl Develop It">Girl Develop It</a>, for which I’m very grateful. I was also invited to attend the Women Techmakers Dinner the night before the conference began. Aside from the delicious food and beautiful setup, it was exciting to be in the company of a couple hundred amazing tech industry women from all over the world.</p>

<p>As one of the Columbus Chapter Leaders for <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/columbus" title="Girl Develop It">Girl Develop It</a> it was exciting to be able to attend a happy hour hosted by the San Francisco chapter near the conference venue! In true Mountain View fashion, we commuted to the happy hour on Google’s brightly-painted fixie bikes.</p>

<p>I’d also like to thank the rest of the Base Two team for letting me jet off to California a little over a week after joining the team (Hello, world!) with only minor grumblings of general jealousy.

  <div class="content">      
    <p><a href="http://jscs.info/">JSCS</a> is my new favorite javascript tool. It helps keep all the javascript files looking the way I want it (and my team wants it). You can read more details about it at their site, but for the purposes of this blog post I’m going to show you how to get it setup with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> or other <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> IDEs.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="installingsetup-jscs">Installing/Setup JSCS</h3>

<p>First we need to install JSCS using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install -g jscs
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then we add a jscs config file (.jscsrc) to your project root directory. This is just a .json file. There are many settings you can set in this config file, but there are some convenient <a href="http://jscs.info/overview#presets">presets</a> for you to use. To keep things simple we’re just going to use the <a href="https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/blob/master/presets/airbnb.json">AirBnB preset</a>. Add this to your .jscsrc file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"preset"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"airbnb"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>From here you can setup your build to run your code against these settings. We use <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> so I’ll just show a quick example on how to set that up.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>var gulp = require('gulp');
var jscs = require('gulp-jscs');

gulp.task('lint', function() {
 return gulp.src('src/**/*.js')
   .pipe(jscs())
   .pipe(jscs.reporter());
});
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Running <code class="highlighter-rouge">gulp lint</code> will run jscs and show you if there are any issues.</p>

<h3 id="webstorm-settings">WebStorm Settings</h3>

<p>Now here’s the main part of the post… Get WebStorm setup to format and lint your code based on the jscs config settings. Most of these steps can be done in JetBrain’s other IDEs. For example, my screenshots are from IntelliJ, but I’ll refer to it as WebStorm for the purposes of this post.</p>

<p>First let’s setup WebStorm’s javascript JSCS settings so it’ll show us the errors in the editor. Open Settings and go to <strong>Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; Javascript &gt; Code Quality Tools &gt; JSCS</strong>. Then you’ll want to enable the checkbox and set the node interpreter and jscs package location. By default JSCS will look for the default config file in the root of your project. You can leave this selected but optionally if you need to select a config file in another location you can do so by selecting the second option. The Code style preset can be set from this window, but we’ve basically already done that by creating our .jscsrc file and setting the preset as airbnb there.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/k4t5I9M.png" alt="JSCS Settings" /></p>

<p>This should start working once you hit ok and you’ll see any format/style issues with your projects javascript files. You can manually clean them up, but I prefer to make my IDE do the work for me. I found a neat way to import your jscs config into WebStorm’s code style settings. Lets set that up now.</p>

<p>Open <strong>Settings</strong> and go to <strong>Editor &gt; Code Style &gt; Javascript</strong>. Then select the <strong>Manage…</strong> button.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/paw2sxV.png" alt="Javascript Code Style Settings" /></p>

<p>This will open another window, select <strong>Import</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ttmSNi7.png" alt="Code Style Schemes" /></p>

<p>This opens yet another window, select <strong>JSCS config file</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GVM7N2m.png" alt="Scheme Import From" /></p>

<p>This will open a <strong>Select Path</strong> dialog window. Just find your project’s root directory and select the .jscsrc file located in the root. Then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LmacVz7.png" alt="Select Path" /></p>

<p>You can select to update the scheme you had selected, or create a new scheme. We’ll create a new scheme called JSCS. Optionally you could also select a Code Style Preset from this window as well. Last click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gFJWKTW.png" alt="Import from JSCS config" /></p>

<p>Now you can close the <strong>Code Style Schemes</strong> dialog. Your javascript code style settings will be as close as possible to your settings in the .jscs config file. Now for the really cool part, the IDE will try to format your javascript based on these setting as you code. You can also take a whole file or section and run <strong>Reformat Code</strong> (my shortcut is <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>) and it will try to clean up that code based on these settings. This is great and will help format your code, but there are some JSCS things this will not fix.</p>

<p>JSCS has the ability to fix a lot of those issues though and you can run the command line</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>jscs /my/project/root --fix
jscs myfilename.js --fix
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or WebStorm has an option to fix JSCS issues in line via context menu on the problem area. Here’s a visual example of what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cOABQHg.png" alt="Fix JSCS context menu" /></p>

<p>This is a little tricky to get this to popup, but if you click on the red squiggly and look for the red light bulb, you have an option to “Fix the current file with JSCS”. This basically does the command line example above, but its a nice in editor feature. After doing this to a few files I was was cleaning up it felt tricky and cumbersome to keep doing it this way and I thought to myself “There must be a shortcut to make this happen?” And so I found one, but you have to manually set it.</p>

<h3 id="add-jscs-shortcut">Add JSCS Shortcut</h3>

<p>Open Settings and select Keymap. Search for JSCS. Then select the Fix JSCS Problems and push the edit (green pencil) button. I set mine to <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> which was unused, but feel free to set it to something else that makes sense to you and/or your team.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DvfLmsi.png" alt="Keymap JSCS Fix shortcut" /></p>

<p>Now whenever you see JSCS errors just use the shortcut key and it’ll clean those babies right up!</p>

  </h2>
  <div class="content">      
    <p>Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to improve your overall efficiency with your computer, but they can be difficult to commit to memory all at once. This month we will suggest a new shortcut each day that we find helpful in our day-to-day lives as front-end web developers. By learning a new shortcut each day you will be well on your way to living a mouse-free life.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>I do much of my day-to-day work on a Windows 7 machine using WebStorm, Visual Studio 2013, and Google Docs. As such, this list of keyboard shortcuts may not be as helpful to users of different platforms and software, though there are generally similar shortcuts available on those systems.</p>

<h4 id="a-name1a-61-move-windows-in-windows"><a name="1"></a> 6/1 Move windows in Windows</h4>

<p>I find the ability to manipulate the position of windows via the keyboard in Windows 7 as one of the greatest features the OS offers - yet many users somehow overlook this simple set of shortcuts. By holding the Windows key and using your keyboard arrow keys you’ll no longer need your mouse to move the active window.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>left-arrow</kbd></td>
      <td>Split left</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>right-arrow</kbd></td>
      <td>Split right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>up-arrow</kbd></td>
      <td>Maximize</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>down-arrow</kbd></td>
      <td>Minimize</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Also, if you have multiple monitors, you can move the window from monitor to monitor by continuing to click the left or right arrow key while holding down the Windows key.</p>

<h4 id="a-name2a-62-move-that-cursor"><a name="2"></a> 6/2: Move that cursor</h4>

<p>Until you learn these simple cursor management shortcuts you likely won’t realize how much time you’ve wasted using your mouse to move the cursor and select words in word documents. Once these are committed to muscle memory you’ll be able to type and edit documents like a pro.</p>

<p>You likely already know that the arrow keys can be used to move the cursor, and you may know that holding the shift key while arrowing allows you to select a character at a time. From there you simply need to remember that the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key can be used as a modifier to do things in larger chunks.</p>

<h4 id="a-name3a-63-google-docs---shortcut-for-everything"><a name="3"></a> 6/3: Google Docs - Shortcut for everything</h4>

<p>Have you ever been working in a Google Doc and wanted to add a numeric list (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>7</kbd>), a bulleted list (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>8</kbd>), or perhaps center the text (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>)? You likely reached for your mouse and visually scanned the format bar for these features because it’s too difficult to remember the individual shortcuts (or there isn’t a shortcut at all as in the case of changing the font). Well, you’re in luck. There’s a single magical shortcut that does it all.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd></td>
      <td>search the menu within Google Docs</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This simple key combination allows you to search the menu options. So, if you want to change the font to “Courier New” you can hit <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>, type “cour”, and hit enter.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/myyRI6w.png" alt="Google Docs search menu" /></p>

<p>Generally the individual shortcut for each feature is still faster, but a shortcut that you can remember is better than one you cannot. Plus, when you use the <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> key combination it will show you the shortcut combination to the right of the option before you apply it - so you have a way to learn the more granular ones over time. If you’d like to learn all of the shortcut keys available in Google Docs there’s a shortcut for that too: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>.</p>

<h4 id="a-name4a-64-super-pasting-powers"><a name="4"></a> 6/4: Super pasting powers</h4>

<p>Often times adding <kbd>shift</kbd> to a keyboard shortcut changes or enhances the shortcut. Most people know that <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> will paste whatever was copied to the clipboard, but many applications offer an enhanced paste with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>.</p>

<p>In Google Docs and Microsoft Word using <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> acts as “paste special”. This allows you to paste the clipboard contents in the document’s format rather than the originally copied format. For example, if you copy bold Comic Sans text from a web page, and then paste into your Arial Google Doc with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>, it will paste in bold Comic Sans (which you clearly don’t want because you’re not a monster); however, if you were to paste with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> it will paste the text content from the website in the matching Arial font style and size.</p>

<p>In IDEs, such as Web Storm and Visual Studio, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> allows you to paste previously copied text. In Web Storm <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> will provide a window to select which of the previously copied texts to paste.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9a65jrl.png" alt="WebStorm paste special" /></p>

<p>Visual Studio will progressively paste the next most recently copied item with each <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> click (while holding <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd>). In both applications <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> will paste the most recently copied text.</p>

<h4 id="a-name5a-65-lock-it-down"><a name="5"></a> 6/5: Lock it down</h4>

<p>Before heading out of the office for lunch (or just going to the bathroom) you should probably lock your computer. Rather than reaching for your mouse and meandering over to the start button, learn this simple shortcut.</p>

<p><kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> (l for lock) will immediately lock your Windows screen.</p>

<h4 id="a-name6a-66-show-me-the-desktop"><a name="6"></a> 6/6: Show me the Desktop</h4>

<p>It’s the weekend and you want to see that pretty desktop image of yours rather than all of the work-related applications and windows. Windows 7 has the nifty little feature that allows you to minimize everything and go straight to your desktop by clicking on the very bottom right of the screen, but that approach is for mouse-lovers, who we are not.</p>

<p><kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> (d for desktop) will take you straight to your desktop without ever glancing at your mouse. If you want to bring all of your applications back up simply hit <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> again.</p>

<h4 id="a-name7a-67-one-handed-browser-tab-management"><a name="7"></a> 6/7: One-handed Browser Tab Management</h4>

<p>At times you may find yourself browsing the web and you think of something different that you want to search for. Many people may click the “add tab” button toward the top of the browser, but that would require touching the mouse and moving it several millimeters up. With just your left hand you can quickly open a new tab and start typing your search.</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th>Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>

      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd></td>
      <td>Switch to next tab to the left</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> will open a new tab in most browsers, and will place the focus in the address bar so that you can immediately begin typing your search (at least in Chrome, which is the browser you should be using). When you’re done with the tab you can close it with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> (w for close?).</p>

<p><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> will allow you to quickly switch to the tab to the right. Adding shift to the close or move right shortcuts will reverse their behavior thereby re-opening the closed tab or moving to the tab on the left (oh the magic of the shift key).</p>

<p>Now you’re able to create, switch, and remove browser tabs all with just your left hand, which frees your right hand to throw your mouse across the room.</p>

<h4 id="a-name8a-68-spreadsheet-columnrow-selection"><a name="8"></a> 6/8: Spreadsheet Column/Row Selection</h4>

<p>It’s Monday and you’re back to work. If you find yourself modifying spreadsheets for even a portion of the day then it’s worthwhile learning some common shortcuts. Today we’ll go over how to select columns and rows without using the mouse.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/x3gocRv.png" alt="Select column" /></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key combination</th>

      <td><kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd></td>
      <td>Select row (Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In both Google Spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to select the column of the active cell (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> for <strong>C</strong>olumn). This is helpful when you want to clear the contents of the column (by clicking <kbd>delete</kbd>), draw your attention to the column, or act on the column in some other way (we’ll go over column insertion and removal in a future post). You can then use <kbd>shift</kbd> and arrow keys to select more columns.</p>

<p>If rows are more your thing then you can use <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to select a row (<kbd>shift</kbd> for “<strong>S</strong>ooo not a column”).</p>

<h4 id="a-name9a-69-spreadsheet-columnrow-insert-and-delete"><a name="9"></a> 6/9: Spreadsheet Column/Row Insert and Delete</h4>

<p>With yesterday’s shortcut you now know how to select a column or row in a spreadsheet. Now it’s time to learn how to do two of the most popular spreadsheet actions: insertion and deletion.</p>

<p>Sadly this is an area where Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet shortcuts differ. We’ll go over Excel shortcuts first.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Excel Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd></td>
      <td>Remove selected column(s) or row(s)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In Excel you first must select the column(s) or row(s) that you wish to act on. Then you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> to add columns or rows or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> to remove columns or rows. When adding columns or rows it inserts the same number of columns or rows that you have selected either left of the selected columns or above the selected rows.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Google Spreadsheet Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd></td>
      <td>Add row(s) above the selected row(s)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd></td>
      <td>Remove selected column(s) or row(s)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Since the column and row shortcuts found in Excel are already browser shortcuts used to zoom in and out (note: if you accidentally zoomed in or out you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd> to return to 100%), Google had to come up with different, less obvious, shortcuts. It is not necessary to select the column or row before using the insertion shortcuts, but by selecting more than one column or row the insertion action will insert the number that is selected.</p>

<p>The insertion shortcuts are <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> for “<strong>I</strong>nsert <strong>C</strong>olumn” and <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> for “<strong>I</strong>nsert <strong>R</strong>ow”. Column and row deletion is <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> for “<strong>E</strong>dit <strong>D</strong>elete”.</p>

<h4 id="a-name10a-610-jump-to-the-address-bar"><a name="10"></a> 6/10: Jump to the Address Bar</h4>

<p>All too often users shift their mouse to the top of the screen simply to place their cursor in the browser address bar. Cut that bad habit with this simple shortcut.</p>

      <td>Place cursor in address bar (all browsers and Windows Explorer)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>When in a browser or Windows folder (Windows Explorer) pressing <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> will place focus in the address bar, and highlight the contents of the address bar so that you can immediately begin typing. This is also helpful when you want to copy the address of the page you are on via <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Add a <kbd>?</kbd> at the beginning of you address bar to force a Google search rather than it potentially being treated as a url as is the case when you search for “asp.net”.</p>

<h4 id="a-name11a-611-switch-active-windows"><a name="11"></a> 6/11: Switch Active Windows</h4>

<p>This one is an oldie and a goodie. Many people already know and use this shortcut without even thinking about it, but for anybody who doesn’t already know how to switch between applications this shortcut is a life changer.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you have multiple applications open you can switch between them with <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> rather than clicking on the taskbar icons with your mouse. Using this keyboard combination will switch you to the most recently used application. If you press the combination again it will switch you back. If you press <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> but keep holding down the <kbd>alt</kbd> key you will see a list of the applications to switch between, and while holding <kbd>alt</kbd> it will switch the selected application for each press of the <kbd>tab</kbd> key.</p>

<h4 id="a-name12a-612-back-and-forward-navigation"><a name="12"></a> 6/12: Back and Forward Navigation</h4>

<p>When browsing the web you will inevitably need to navigate backward - whether it’s to get back to your search results or to return to an embarrassingly <a href="http://api.ning.com/files/OQbVc*b-KB9N8WhlPa*p43ZhR5D2*6BzUXEABZ-BvbE*si9pe31-k6QHTC6RP0wiV1YKvbHXTJCadfhxHgVI9CDC4JZ*vNiK/cutedog1920x1200.jpg" target="_blank">cute picture</a> that you stumbled upon. You’re in luck - there’s a shortcut for that.</p>

      <td><kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>right-arrow</kbd></td>
      <td>Navigate forward in browsers and Windows Explorer</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Using <kbd>alt</kbd> and you’re left and right arrow keys you can navigate your browser history like a pro. This also works with Windows Explorer so you can quickly open folders and navigate back all day. Note that <kbd>backspace</kbd> and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>backspace</kbd> will also navigate backward / forward assuming you’re focus isn’t in an input field, but the <kbd>alt</kbd> key approach is convenient because it always works.</p>

<h4 id="a-name13a-613-facebook-stream-navigation"><a name="13"></a> 6/13: Facebook Stream Navigation</h4>

<p>I’m sure you don’t use Facebook at work, but now that it’s the weekend it’s fair game. There’s a better way to scroll through your stream than using the mouse or arrow keys.</p>

    <tr>
      <td><kbd>k</kbd></td>
      <td>Scroll to previous post (Facebook, Google+, various other sites)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>Using the <kbd>j</kbd> key you can scroll down your social stream while sipping on your weekend <a href="https://eytanuliel.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/giant-margarita.jpg" target="_blank">margarita</a>. If you skipped past something interesting click <kbd>k</kbd>. Be careful that you don’t have focus in an input field otherwise you’re going to have a pretty funny status update (jjjjjkjkjjk).</p>

<h4 id="a-name14a-614-browser-refresh"><a name="14"></a> 6/14: Browser Refresh</h4>

<p>Web developers refresh their browser approximately 1337 times a day, but even the average user occasionally needs to refresh.</p>

<table>

      <th>Result</th>

      <td>Refresh the browser ignoring cache (Chrome, Firefox)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> will refresh the browser as if you clicked the browser refresh button. Chrome and Firefox also provide <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>, which will reload the page and all of the assets rather than relying on cached data. This comes in handy when you’re a web developer troubleshooting a problem.</p>

<p>Note that <kbd>F5</kbd> and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> perform the same refresh and refresh ignoring cache actions, but they’re a bit more of a finger stretch.</p>

<h4 id="a-name15a-615-folder-and-file-browsing"><a name="15"></a> 6/15: Folder and File Browsing</h4>

<p>The most common (and slowest) way to browse folders and files is to double click on My Computer, and then begin clicking and scrolling folders. Using a few keyboard shortcuts will get you where you want to be in a snap.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>

      <td>Opens Windows Explorer (the equivalent of double clicking “My Computer”)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd></td>
      <td>Opens the Run window</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you like starting at “My Computer” (labeled as just “Computer” in Windows 7) then <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> is your new best friend. It opens the Computer directory up immediately so that you can begin to navigate the folders.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/johmmCX.png" alt="My computer" /></p>

<p>Folders can be navigated quickly by arrowing down/up to the folder you wish to open and then clicking <kbd>enter</kbd>. If you’re staring at a long list of folders then you can jump quickly to the folder you want by beginning to type the name of the folder. If you’ve opened a folder by accident you can use the <a href="#12">navigate back shortcut</a> that we learned previously (<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>left-arrow</kbd>). When you’re done navigating you can close the folder with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> as we learned in <a href="#7">One-handed Browser Tab Management</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer to start at a different folder than Computer you can use the run command <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> and then type the folder you want to jump to (such as c:/windows), and the click <kbd>enter</kbd>.</p>

<h4 id="a-name16a-616-rename-folder-or-file"><a name="16"></a> 6/16: Rename Folder or File</h4>

<p>Yesterday you learned how to navigate folders and files without a mouse, but if you wanted to rename one of those folders or files you would still need to right click with your mouse. No more! Today we learn the simple shortcut that allows for renaming.</p>

<table>
  <thead>

      <th>Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>F2</kbd></td>
      <td>Rename file in Windows Explorer, edit cell in Microsoft Excel</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Yes, the function keys in the great north of your keyboard do have a purpose. When browsing files and folders clicking <kbd>F2</kbd> will put the selected folder or file in rename mode with the full name already selected. Therefore if you want to fully rename the folder or file you can just start typing. If, instead, you only wanted to modify the name then after hitting <kbd>F2</kbd> hit <kbd>arrow-right</kbd> to remove the highlight.</p>

<h4 id="a-name17a-617-new-browser-window"><a name="17"></a> 6/17: New Browser Window</h4>

<p>Occasionally you want a new browser window rather than a new tab - especially if you plan to split screen or you are using multiple monitors. Before you drag that new tab out of the window learn this shortcut.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key combination</th>
      <th>Result</th>

      <td>Open new icognito window (Chrome)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> to open a new window (<strong>n</strong> for <strong>N</strong>ew window). This shortcut works similarly in various other applications. For instance, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> will create a new document in Word and a new tab in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AI7u4Ek.png" alt="Chrome incognito" /></p>

<p>If you’re feeling a little sneakier you open a new Icognito window in Chrome via <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>. Icognito mode allows your to browse without storing history, cookies, etc. This is helpful if you’re doing web development or if you’re buying your significant other a surprise gift.</p>

<h4 id="a-name18a-618-find-what-youre-looking-for"><a name="18"></a> 6/18: Find What You’re Looking For</h4>

<p>When you’re looking for a specific term on a web page or document the application’s search functionality can be a savior, but ironically the search functionality can be difficult to find. Stop searching for the search so that you can begin searching with these shortcuts.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gTzjt7w.png" alt="My computer" /></p>

    <tr>
      <td><kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>F3</kbd></td>
      <td>Find previous in most applications</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Next time there is a term you want to search for simply press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> to be placed in the application’s search form. You can then generally begin typing your search (you may need to hit enter to submit it). If there are multiple results you can go to the next result with <kbd>F3</kbd>, and if you accidentally pass what you were looking for you can search backward with <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>F3</kbd>.</p>

<h4 id="a-name19a-619-start-with-the-win-key"><a name="19"></a> 6/19: Start with the Win Key</h4>

<p>The Windows 7 Start menu is fairly useful, but most people don’t know the shortcuts to take full advantage of it.</p>

      <td>Move selection to next section (right column, shutdown, left column)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>win</kbd> and then type</td>
      <td>Search applications and files</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Pressing the <kbd>win</kbd> key will open the Start menu. From there you can immediately start typing to search for and open applications. For instance, if you want to open Google Chrome you can generally hit <kbd>win</kbd>, type “ch”, and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> (you may need to type more than just “ch” depending on your installed applications and how recently you’ve opened Chrome in this manner).</p>

<p>Once the Start menu is open you can also use the arrow keys, <kbd>tab</kbd>, and <kbd>enter</kbd> to navigate. The arrow keys will move up and down the current column, <kbd>tab</kbd> will move you between the sections (right column, shutdown, left column), and <kbd>enter</kbd> will open the currently selected item.</p>

<p>So hit <kbd>win</kbd> and give it a try!</p>

<p>Like many shortcuts, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> acts differently depending on where it is used. We learned in the <a href="#17">New Browser Window</a> post that it opens a new Incognito window in Google Chrome. When used in Windows Explorer, <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> creates a new folder with the name highlighted so that you can immediately begin typing to rename the folder. With this shortcut you can quickly create multiple folders without ever lifting your hands off of the keyboard.</p>

<p>Also remember that many other shortcuts that you likely are familiar with work within Windows Explorer.</p>

<p>Today is Father’s Day so we’ll keep this one short and sweet. We’re all prone to make mistakes (especially fathers suffering from sleep deprivation). That’s why it’s worth mastering the art of undo and redo.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake in a word document, browser field, Windows Explorer, or almost any other application <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> will reverse the mistake. Think <strong>Z</strong> for <a href="http://s.emuparadise.org/fup/up/95763-Zorro_(1995)_(1995)(Capstone_Software)-1.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>Z</strong>orro</a> cutting through your mistake. Most applications keep a list of changes so that you can undo multiple times.</p>

<p>If after an undo you realize that the change was valid and you want to undo the undo (aka redo) use the power of the <kbd>shift</kbd> key to reverse the shortcut (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd>).</p>

<p>You can also access the redo functionality with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>y</kbd> as in wh<strong>Y</strong> does this shortcut exist?</p>

<h4 id="a-name22a-622-print-screen-and-window-capture"><a name="22"></a> 6/22: Print Screen and Window Capture</h4>

<p>Occasionally you want to take a screenshot so that you can share what you’re looking at with another person, but is there a shortcut for that?</p>

    <tr>
      <td><kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>print screen</kbd></td>
      <td>Capture selected window onto clipboard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Pressing <kbd>print screen</kbd> will seem like it didn’t do anything, but it tells Windows to take a screenshot of the full screen and add it to your clipboard. Once added to your clipboard you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> to paste it into an email, word document, or any other application that supports images. Just want to capture the current window rather than the full screen? Add <kbd>alt</kbd> to the mix.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’d like to capture something smaller than the active window you can use Windows 7’s “Snipping Tool”. Open it using the Start Menu shortcuts you learned in <a href="#19">Start with the Win Key</a>.</p>

<h4 id="a-name24a-624-submit-post-when-enter-doesnt-work"><a name="24"></a> 6/24: Submit Post When Enter Doesn’t Work</h4>

<p>On many websites, such as Facebook, pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> will add a newline rather than submit your post. This is helpful when you’re typing up your status, but how can you submit that status for the world to see without condescending to use the mouse to click the Post button?</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key combination</th>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>Submit / send post (Facebook, Gmail)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd></td>
      <td>Newline (Excel, Google Spreadsheet)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Clicking <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> when typing a Facebook post submits that post. It’s like telling Facebook “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI5ijh15OYg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=17s" target="_blank">This is my final answer</a>”. This shortcut also works in Gmail to send an email that you are composing.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YG4uNGU.png" alt="Facebook post" /></p>

<p>On the flipside, if you’re in a field that uses the <kbd>enter</kbd> key to submit the entry (such as Excel cells), you can generally use <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> to create a newline.</p>

<h4 id="a-name25a-625-jump-to-website-search-box"><a name="25"></a> 6/25: Jump to Website Search Box</h4>

<p>Have you ever wondered if there is a shortcut that immediately places your cursor in a website’s search box? Probably not, but after learning this shortcut you’ll never risk wondering.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xUhbXtO.png" alt="Twitter search" /></p>

    <tr>
      <td><kbd>/</kbd></td>
      <td>Place cursor in search box (Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>When you are within Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and many other websites pressing the <kbd>/</kbd> (front slash) key will place your cursor in the search box so that you can search mouse-free. Since the front slash shares the key with the <kbd>?</kbd> you can remember this shortcut by thinking, “How can I find what I’m looking for <strong>?</strong>”.</p>

<h4 id="a-name26a-626-gmail-bullets-and-indentation"><a name="26"></a> 6/26: Gmail Bullets and Indentation</h4>

<p>Numeric and bulleted lists are a clean and concise way to communicate a list of items, but Gmail hides the options within the formatting bar. Learn these shortcuts to be a top lister.</p>

      <th>Key combination</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td>Unindent line or selection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd></td>
      <td>Add new line without bullet</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c4KgJfU.png" alt="Gmail bulleting" /></p>

<p><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>7</kbd> will get you started with a numeric list. If bullets are more your thing than swap the <kbd>7</kbd> for an <kbd>8</kbd>. <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd> can be used to indent a line, and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> will unident it. Think of the braces as really flat arrows pointing in the direction you want the list to be indented. If you’ve ever wondered how to add a new line between bullets without adding a new bullet you simply need to add <kbd>shift</kbd> to the <kbd>enter</kbd> for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkyLnWm1iCs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m38s" target="_blank">more power</a>.</p>

<p>Learning these shortcuts will help you create bulleted lists both in Gmail and Google Docs.</p>

<h4 id="a-name27a-627-browser-bookmarks"><a name="27"></a> 6/27: Browser Bookmarks</h4>

<p>Want to add the current website as a bookmark? There’s a shortcut to make that bookmark star turn yellow.</p>

      <td>Toggle bookmark bar open/close (Chrome, Firefox, IE)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To bookmark the current page press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> (try it now!). Think <strong>D</strong> as in “<strong>D</strong>oubt I’ll remember this website if I don’t bookmark it”.</p>

<p>If you’d like to see your bookmark bar (or hide it) <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> is the way to do it.</p>

<h4 id="a-name28a-628-slack-channel-selector"><a name="28"></a> 6/28: Slack Channel Selector</h4>

<p>We use <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> for our company’s internal communications. It’s what you would get if AIM and IRC had a much cuter baby. It provides multiple channels (like chat rooms) to have conversations, but having to click on the channel you want to view is silly when there is a shortcut for that.</p>

<p>With <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> you can jump between Slack conversations without lifting your fingers off of the keyboard.</p>

<h4 id="a-name29a-629-chrome-dev-tools"><a name="29"></a> 6/29: Chrome Dev Tools</h4>

<p>The Chrome Dev Tools is an indispensable tool for web developers, but even non-developers can use it to get a better understanding of what may be going wrong with a web page that they are viewing. Here is a list of shortcuts that I use on a daily basis.</p>

    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd></td>
      <td>Navigate to source file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd></td>
      <td>Go to line number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd></td>
      <td>Add breakpoint (when in source file)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>F8</kbd></td>
      <td>Resume from breakpoint while debugging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>F10</kbd></td>
      <td>Step over next function while debugging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>F11</kbd></td>
      <td>Step into next function while debugging</td>

    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd></td>
      <td>Clear console</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The average user may only care to know how to open the Chrome Dev Tools (<kbd>F12</kbd>), which is great, but if you’re a web developer you should commit to memorizing all of these shortcuts to make your working life a little bit easier.</p>

  <div class="content">      
    <p>I was recently confronted with a situation that required me to search and replace my code in a way that the left and right of my search needed to be replaced, but the middle needed to remain the same. Could this be done with a single search and replace?</p>

<!--

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>For reasons that I do not care to detail here, I found myself needing to replace every instance of my Visual Studio solution where a <code class="highlighter-rouge">template</code> line matching</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>template: require('Project/DynamicComponentName/DynamicComponentName.html')
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>is replaced with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">templateUrl</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>templateUrl: 'Project/DynamicComponentName/DynamicComponentName.html'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In this example the DynamicComponentName is different in every instance.</p>

<p>Rather than manually identifying every template line and make the necessary changes I wanted to do a single search and replace and be done with it. Regex felt like the right answer, but how?</p>

<h3 id="regex-groups">Regex Groups</h3>

<p>Regex, or regular expressions, is a very powerful (read as: “complicated to use and understand”) pattern matching grammar. It provides for more advanced searching capabilities than a standard text-base search. Luckily Visual Studio provides for searching via Regex (screenshot is of Visual Studio 2013).</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MAzCFjd.jpg" alt="Visual Studio regex search option" /></p>

<p>With <strong>Use Regular Expressions</strong> selected in Visual Studio we can take advantage of regex, including its group capturing via parentheses.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Find what</strong> we can place the following regex query</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>template: require\('Project/(.*)'\)

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This tells Visual Studio to match everything that directly matches <code class="highlighter-rouge">template: require(Project/</code>&lt;any number of characters&gt;<code class="highlighter-rouge">)'</code>. Note that the require’s parentheses needed to be escaped with <code class="highlighter-rouge">\</code> because the parentheses are part of the regex syntax. You can use the <a href="http://www.regexr.com/">http://www.regexr.com/</a> online tool to test the regex matcher on your own.</p>

<p>Now if we place the following in the <strong>Replace with</strong> field we’ll be able to place the contents captured by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">(.*)</code> capture group using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> syntax.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>templateUrl: 'Project$1'

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The contents of the capture group will be placed in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$1</code> slot. If you had more than one capture group then you would simply increment the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">$2</code>, etc) based on the order that the capture groups appeared in the search term.</p>

<p>Now hit <strong>Replace</strong> for each instance and you’re good to go.</p>

<p>In my situation I really wanted to use <strong>Replace All</strong>, but Visual Studio 2013 seems to have an issue with Replace All using regex. Using Replace All results in Visual Studio stating that it cannot find any matches. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDrW7sc52Ck&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=48">Silly Visual Studio</a>.</p>

    <a href="/2015/05/06/git-configured/" title="Git Configured" rel="bookmark" class="title">Git Configured</a>
  </h2>
  <div class="content">      
    <p>Git configurations are like snowflakes - no two are exactly the same. At least that’s what we found to be true at <a href="http://base2.io">Base Two</a>. Each developer had his own ignores, aliases, and other tricks, which worked fine in isolation, but became troublesome when we tried to describe to one another how to interact with Git in the console. To restore sanity we have begun to standardize our Git configurations.</p>

<!--

<p>The standardization of our Git configuration files is part of our larger effort to document our overall <a href="https://github.com/b2io/development-standards">development standards</a>. In addition to configuration files we’re outlining our overall Git workflow and commit messaging standards, but I <a href="http://gph.to/1EPa17p">digress</a>.</p>

<p>The two primary divergents in our configurations were aliases and ignore files.</p>

<h3 id="alias-all-the-things">Alias all the things</h3>

<p>If you’re working with Git from the command line (that’s what all the cool kids do) your fingers are going to get tired without aliases. Who has the time to type <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code> when you could accomplish the same thing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git s</code>? That’s <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/five">5</a> fewer characters!</p>

<p>Honestly, though, aliases are a great way to make Git on the command line manageable. Here is the global <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitconfig</code> file that contains the aliases that we use:</p>

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/b2io/development-standards/blob/master/source-control/.gitconfig"></script>

<h3 id="ignore-some-of-the-things">Ignore some of the things</h3>

<p>Source control is great for keeping your code safe, but mixed with all of that code are IDE files, merge files, build artifacts, and plenty of other files you’d prefer to not have pollute your repository. That’s where <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> files come into play. You likely already have one or more gitignore files in your repository, but did you know that you can create a global ignore file? This is a great place to configure all of the common files you’d like to ignore, which is especially appreciated when you wish to contribute to an open source project (the other people on the project likely don’t care about your Visual Studio Resharper user settings file).</p>

<p>To create a global ignore file simply add <code class="highlighter-rouge">excludesfile = ~/.gitignore</code> to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">[core]</code> section of your global <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitconfig</code> file (see above), and then create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> file as a peer to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitconfig</code>. Here is the ignore file that we recommend:</p>

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/b2io/development-standards/blob/master/source-control/.gitignore"></script>

    <p>Web development can be like trying to complete a puzzle that has had its pieces dumped into a box with multiple other puzzles. There are so many puzzle pieces that it can be difficult to even know what picture you should end up with at the end.</p>

<p>While every project is it’s own puzzle, there are a lot of common pieces out there. Here’s a walk-through of how we got some of our favorite pieces (<strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Rails</strong>, <strong>Vagrant</strong>, and more) to fit together.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="what-pieces-do-we-have">What Pieces Do We Have?</h3>

<p>Below is the list of technologies we use in this example. For your reference I’m on a 64 bit version of Windows 7. Be aware that if you’re using something else your results may vary.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/files/">RubyGems</a></strong> (2.3.0): Ruby’s package system.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api">Rails-api</a></strong> (0.2.1): A lightweight version of Rails to provide API capabilities without the extra pieces that Rails brings to the table.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a></strong> (1.4.3) with <strong><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a></strong> (4.3.14): Allows for the configuration of reproducible and portable virtual machines.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source">Puppet</a></strong>: Provisioner for Vagrant.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a></strong> (1.2.16): Front-end JavaScript framework.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a></strong> (1.9.0): Distributed source control.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://nodejs.org/">npm</a></strong> (1.4.14): We use this for the installation of some of the other tools.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a></strong> (1.2.0): Web scaffolding tool that we use to scaffold angular via the <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular">angular generator</a>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a></strong> (0.1.13): The build system that comes with Yeoman.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a></strong> (1.3.8): The package manager that comes with Yeoman.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="generate-the-rails-app">Generate the Rails App</h3>

<p>There are many ways that we can begin to put this puzzle together. We’re going to start by generating the Rails app. For this example we’ll use <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_app</code> as our application’s name.</p>

<p>In your terminal (I use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/files/">Console2</a>) navigate to the location you’d like your application’s root folder to be placed in. If you don’t already have rails-api installed then do that now.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install rails-api
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Generate your Rails app with the following</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails-api new my_app
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now let’s make a few changes to what was auto-generated for us. <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd my_app</code> and remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/test/</code> directory because we’ll be using rspec for testing instead.</p>

<p>Open your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> and update it to include the gems that you’ll need. Here’s what we used, but you’ll want to upgrade to the latest packages for your application.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tborres/67ed702ad8cfafaeec05.js?file=Gemfile"></script>

<p>We also need to change our <code class="highlighter-rouge">database.yml</code> file because we’ll be using PostgreSQL rather than SQLite.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tborres/67ed702ad8cfafaeec05.js?file=database.yml"></script>

<h3 id="vagrant-and-puppet">Vagrant and Puppet</h3>

<p>Now that our bare-bones Rails-api app is created we’ll setup Vagrant. Vagrant will allow us to provision and run a virtual machine in a consistent way. This will remove the “it worked on my machine” problem that often plagues developers.</p>

<p>We’ll use the rails-dev-box as our base since it has many of the features we’ll need. You can clone the repository from here: <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box">https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box</a></p>

<p>Now copy the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vagrantfile</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/puppet/</code> directory from the rails-dev-box into the root of your application (as a peer to your Rails <code class="highlighter-rouge">/app/</code> directory). Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vagrantfile</code> in your favorite text editor (I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>), and change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.vm.hostname</code> from <code class="highlighter-rouge">‘rails-dev-box’</code> to the name of your app. This will make it a little less confusing when you’re in your VM.</p>

<p>Now open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/puppet/manifests/default.pp</code> puppet manifest file. This file contains a lot of optional configurations that we will not be using. Make the following changes to the file:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ar_databases</code> values to your application name rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">activerecord_unittest</code>.
Example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ar_databases = ['my_app_dev', 'my_app_test']</code></li>
  <li>Remove the SQLite and MySQL sections because we’ll be using PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Add the following Puppet modules (<em>which can be installed on Windows by first downloading the tar.gz file, extracting it, copying the resulting folder into the app’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">/puppet/modules/</code> directory, and then renaming the folder to it’s module name</em> :
    <ul>
      <li>nodejs: <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/nodejs">https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/nodejs</a></li>
      <li>stdlib: <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib">https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib</a></li>
      <li>apt: <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt">https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This version of Ubuntu’s npm is out of date so we need to make an adjustment to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/puppet/modules/nodejs/manifests/init.pp</code> file. You’ll need to set <code class="highlighter-rouge">$manage_repo = true</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">default.pp</code> file replace the nodejs section with <code class="highlighter-rouge">include nodejs</code></li>
  <li>Add the puppet-yeoman module from <a href="https://github.com/nickhartjes/puppet-yeoman">https://github.com/nickhartjes/puppet-yeoman</a> by
    <ul>
      <li>Cloning the repository</li>
      <li>Copy the <code class="highlighter-rouge">init.pp</code> file into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/puppet/modules/yeoman/manifests/init.pp</code> directory.</li>
      <li>Remove <code class="highlighter-rouge">“curl”</code> from the yeomanPackages because it already exists in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">default.pp</code>.</li>
      <li>Change <code class="highlighter-rouge">require =&gt; Exec['apt-get update']</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">require =&gt; Class['apt_get_update']</code></li>
      <li>Add a call to the module at the bottom of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">default.pp</code> file with <code class="highlighter-rouge">include yeoman</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the angular generator for yeoman by adding the following to the bottom of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">default.pp</code> file:</li>
</ol>

<p><code data-gist-id="67ed702ad8cfafaeec05" data-gist-file="default.pp" data-gist-line="109-113"></code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the root of your Rails directory in your console and start vagrant with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vagrant up</code> command.</li>
  <li>Now access your VM via ssh</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>vagrant ssh
&gt; cd /vagrant/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Update the bundle, and rake the database</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    &gt; bundle update
    &gt; rake db:create
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="angular">Angular!</h3>

<p>Now we’ll add a basic angular structure to our application.</p>

<p>Create an <code class="highlighter-rouge">/angular/</code> directory within your rails directory (as a peer to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/app/</code> directory).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	&gt; mkdir angular &amp;&amp; cd angular
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Run the angular generator (within your Vagrant VM) and answer the questions to match your needs (I answered yes to all).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	&gt; yo angular my_app
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you ran into any errors during the generation you may need to run the bower install and npm install manually.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	&gt; bower install
	&gt; sudo npm install
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now adjust your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gruntfile.js</code> within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/angular/</code> directory so that dist places the build files in the rails <code class="highlighter-rouge">/public/</code> directory.</p>

<p><code data-gist-id="67ed702ad8cfafaeec05" data-gist-file="Gruntfile.js" data-gist-line="21-24"></code></p>

<p>Also add the following to the connect section (replacing the livereload section) so that your files are proxied during development.</p>

<p><code data-gist-id="67ed702ad8cfafaeec05" data-gist-file="Gruntfile.js" data-gist-line="76-98"></code></p>

<p>Build the angular assets with Grunt (from within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/angular/</code> directory)!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	&gt; grunt build
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you see an error dealing with lodash it is likely the result of long file paths. The latest stable version of npm does not support a fix for this. You’ll need to run npm and grunt from your local development machine rather than Vagrant.</p>

<h3 id="done---frame-that-puzzle-with-git">Done! - Frame that puzzle (with Git)</h3>

<p>You’ve successfully created your bare structure for web development. It may feel like you just put all the pieces of the puzzle together to find that the picture is blank, but at least now you have a canvas to paint a your cat pictures on. Let keep that canvas safe by storing it on Git.</p>

<p>Initialize the git repository from the root Rails directory (this can be done within the console of your local development machine).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; git init
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Add the following to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/.vagrant 	#this contains your local vm box info which is not needed by the team
</code></pre>
</div>

    <p>At Base Two, we expect our developers be familiar working with multiple layers of the web stack. Many of us got our feet wet building Rails applications and have recently been having a lot of fun building single page javascript and mobile applications with <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://www.bower.io">Bower</a>.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="thick-client--happy-clients">Thick Client === Happy Clients</h3>

<p>First some background on us. We are a technology company that builds web, mobile, desktop and embedded solutions for clients big and small. We have worked to get our startup clients from the incubator to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/cincinnati-startup-sqrl-raises-550k-and-launches-document-reminder-service/">seed-stage funding</a> and have helped our large corporate clients like <a href="http://www.aep.com">AEP</a> communicate better by converting processes typically carried out in excel spreadsheet into rich web experiences (and on Internet Explorer 8, no less!).</p>

<p>When we first began our work with AEP, we had just been contracted to do some shadow IT for one of the company’s business units. Our first question in our first meeting was, “We know you do a lot of .NET here, but would you mind if we gave Ruby on Rails a go?”. It should have been a red flag that there were no internal IT representatives in the room, but we weren’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. The business unit signed off on our project and gave us the go-ahead to write a Rails application.</p>

<p>We decided that – given the project’s requirements – a thick javascript client with a Rails JSON API made a lot of sense. We were comfortable developing BDD Rails applications quickly and felt like a clear separation of the front and back-end would allow developers to work better in parallel.</p>

<p>Three months later, when our client’s IT department stepped in to mandate that the project be completed in .NET, we had a single page javascript application and knew what the JSON endpoints were supposed to look like. Over the next 6 months, we swapped the Rails services for .NET and continued adding features to our thick client application. All of this to say, thick clients + JSON APIs are a really flexible way to do development and, while they aren’t the answer to every problem, they rock, we have fun building them and in this particular case, they saved our client a lot of time and money.</p>

<h3 id="automating-front-end-workflow">Automating Front-end Workflow</h3>

<p>Last fall, I viewed a slide deck from <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a> that completely blew my mind. The name of that deck was <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/automating-front-end-workflow">“Automating Front-end Workflow”</a>, and it has completely changed the way I do development.</p>

<p>In particular, we have adopted <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> for scaffolding new applications, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> for automating tasks (minifying scripts, compiling SASS and Coffeescript, running static code analysis, unit and end to end tests, and even removing unused CSS rules) and <a href="http://www.bower.io">Bower</a> for managing dependencies. Scaffolding, previewing, testing and building a new <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> with Yeoman is as simple as:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ztbrown/9549171.js"></script>

<p>At this point, if we wanted, we could begin test-driving the front-end with mock services while another developer begins writing Rails/PHP/.NET/Go/etc.</p>

<h3 id="build-artifacts-in-version-control--best-practice">Build Artifacts in Version Control !== Best Practice</h3>

<p>So, here’s where the dream died a little for me. We use Heroku for hosting our Rails applications and deploy to Heroku with Git. When Heroku receives the push, it recognizes and builds our Rails application just fine, but does nothing to the subdirectory containing our javascript application.</p>

<p>Our build workflow looked like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>After merging changes into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> checkout new branch called <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code></li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">grunt build</code> (target is <code class="highlighter-rouge">./public</code> in the Rails root directory)</li>
  <li>Commit changes</li>
  <li>Push to remote</li>
  <li>Issue pull request to <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code></li>
  <li>Merge changes</li>
  <li>Push <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> to Heroku</li>
</ul>

<p>I get worn out just reading that list.</p>

<p>If the threat of extra work isn’t compelling enough to convince you that this isn’t the right way to be doing things, how about this: build artifacts simply do not belong in source control. If only Heroku could recognize our Rails application and also know to fetch our front-end dependencies and run our Grunt tasks.</p>

<h3 id="automating-multiple-builds-on-heroku">Automating Multiple Builds on Heroku</h3>

<p>I’d like to say that I got fed up with the above build process and went searching for a better way, but that would be–at best–a half-truth. A few months ago, we got an email from an Advocate at Heroku named Christopher Lauer asking if he could chat with us about ways to improve our Heroku experience. I had no idea they did this kind of thing and was thrilled to get a forum to ask questions about the platform.</p>

<p>This is where Christopher turned me on to the idea of using multiple build packs. I had no idea what buildpacks were, so I started poking around. From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push heroku</code>, Heroku’s slug compiler prepares your code for execution by the Heroku dyno manager. At the heart of the slug compiler is a collection of scripts called a buildpack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so buildpacks are the steps Heroku uses to build my application once it recognizes that I’m using Ruby/Node/etc. So how do I tell Heroku that it should stop trying to recognize my environment and instead let me call the shots? It’s a simple environment variable. So, if I want Heroku to look for a Ruby/Rails application, I would configure it to use the ruby buildpack:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ztbrown/9549245.js"></script>

<p>If, instead, I would like it to run a package.json and install dependencies like Compass and Grunt, I would configure it like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ztbrown/9549263.js"></script>

<p>But this doesn’t yet solve my problem. Enter, multi build packs.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ztbrown/9549269.js"></script>

<p>Now, when you push to Heroku, the service will first look for a package.json and Gruntfile in the root (I point the Gruntfile to the Gruntfile in my subdirectory with grunt-hub) before bundling and spinning up a Rails server.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git rm -rf /public
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Removing my build artifacts from Github was a triumphant moment. Concurrently developing for the front and back-end feels humane.</p>

    <a href="/2014/03/09/wireframes-for-developers/" title="Wireframes for Developers" rel="bookmark" class="title">Wireframes for Developers</a>
  </h2>
  <div class="content">      
    <p>Wireframes are a great way to visually communicate the expected user behavior of an application to your team and your client. So, is this post for an information architect to better understand what developers are looking for, or for developers wanting to create wireframes for their clients? Well, the answer is both.</p>

<!--
<p>On smaller teams, where the developer is the one gathering the requirements, wireframes can help to demonstrate to the client that the team understands the overall solution. Wireframes also can save everybody a lot of time by identifying usability issues upfront - before the application is coded.</p>

<p>Larger teams may have a dedicated information architect who acts as a liaison between the client and the development team. In this case the wireframes are the primary artifact for the developers to understand the requirements of the application. Therefore it is important that the edge cases that developers look for are accounted for in the wireframes.</p>

<h3 id="know-your-tool">Know Your Tool</h3>

<p>There are a lot of good wireframing tools available online. The one we use is <a href="http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/">Balsamiq Mockups</a>. It is reasonably priced, easy to use, and contains the basic functionality needed to create wireframes without a lot of extra fluff. Depending on your teams needs this tool may or may not work for you. Regardless of your wireframing tool, I recommend that you take some time to learn your tool.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shortcuts - Does the application have shortcuts that will help you wireframe with ease?</li>
  <li>Templating - Is there a way to template common items so that changes can be made in one place rather than copying and pasting?</li>
  <li>Presentation - How can the final wireframes be demonstrated? Export to pdf, png, or live presentation mode?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="know-your-resolution">Know Your Resolution</h3>

<p>Are you creating a website, desktop app, or mobile app? Your wireframes should be sized based on the lowest resolution the application will support. If you are targeting multiple platforms then it will be necessary to create different sets of wireframes. For instance, you may need to have a set that is based on a mobile device, and another set at 1024x768 for a web browser.</p>

<h3 id="data-matters">Data Matters</h3>

<p>In most cases lorem ipsum is not going to cut it. Developers may not read your annotations (and they probably won’t), but they will expect the data on the screen to be consistent. Your example data and wireframes should tell a story. If you show John Doe selected in a list then John Doe should be selected in the detail view as well. Also, you shouldn’t simply copy and paste a bunch on “John Doe” items to populate the list. Doing this could lead the developer to think that each person should be listed multiple times.</p>

<p>To make example data easier and more fun to create go out to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">imdb</a> and use the cast of one of your favorite shows. It’s especially helpful if you use a tv show or movie that works with your type of application. For instance, if the application is for a business then <em>Mad Men</em> may work. A To-do app could be <em>Breaking Bad</em>. However, be aware that your show selection may say more about yourself then you care to share, and not all shows are client-safe.</p>

<h3 id="think-like-a-user">Think Like a User</h3>

<p>The most important player in this game is the user. So it’s important to think like one. Mentally navigate the application like a user. Log in, go to the home screen, and think “What do I want to do now?”. You can get all of the client’s features in the application, but if the user doesn’t know how to intuitively navigate to those features it’s a loss cause.</p>

<h3 id="think-like-a-developer">Think Like a Developer</h3>

<p>Developers think in edge cases. They don’t question if the glass is half full or half empty - they ask, “What if there is no glass? What if there is no table for the glass to sit on?”. It’s important to show the happy path in your wireframes so that everybody knows how it works, but it’s also important to show how the application should react when things go wrong. What happens if required data is not entered, the user forgets his or her password, or there are no results to show in a list?</p>

<h3 id="think-like-an-application">Think Like an Application</h3>

<p>Unlike your wireframes, the application you’re designing is not static. The screen size may be different, and the result list may be large or small. Your wireframes should visually describe how the application should adjust to handle these differences. Where can scrolling occur? Do certain portions of the screen stretch as more space is available? Should text truncate with an ellipsis when it is too long to fit?</p>

  </h2>
  <div class="content">      
    <p>A lot of our projects have some form of autocomplete functionality baked into them; but recently we had a client ask for something a little more <em>mistake proof</em>. A lot of users in this particular application will be searching for something based on the sound of a word and not really know the exact spelling.</p>

<p>In talking over examples of how the new autocomplete should match, the product owner sent us in the direction of a possible solution he’d had some experience with in the past: the Soundex algorithm.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="this-one-is-too-cold">This one is too cold</h3>

<p>To give a little more context, this particular application is hosted on Heroku and uses a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. Given that, we started by seeing what PostgreSQL can do for us. As it turns out, it’s got support for Soundex <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/fuzzystrmatch.html">right out of the box</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Soundex system is a method of matching similar-sounding names by converting them to the same code. It was initially used by the United States Census in 1880, 1900, and 1910. Note that Soundex is not very useful for non-English names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That might be exactly what another application needed, but we aren’t dealing with people’s names, we’re dealing with brand names. Time to break out our SQL-fu and see how the results hold up.</p>

<p>First things first, you’ll need to have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fuzzystrmatch</code> module installed on PostgreSQL database. You can do that by dropping into the PSQL console and running: <code class="highlighter-rouge">CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;</code>. Now in a query you can run something a query to get some results:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/9223335.js?file=soundex.sql"></script>

<p>Looking those over for our data-set, we aren’t getting at all the results we’d want. Time to start looking at other options…</p>

<h3 id="this-one-is-too-hot">This one is too hot</h3>

<p>A little farther down <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/fuzzystrmatch.html">that page of PostgreSQL documentation</a> is the Levenshtein distance algorithm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds promising, let’s give that a try. The Levenshtein function comes packaged in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fuzzystrmatch</code> module with Soundex, so no need to go back into the PSQL console, instead we’ll start with a query:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/9223335.js?file=levenshtein.sql"></script>

<p>It wasn’t immediately clear how Levenstein was sorting the results. But further investigations revealed that output of the function is the <em>edit distance</em> between the two strings; which is to say: how many changes you need to make to the get from one string to the other.</p>

<p>Once again, the results from this aren’t really what we’re looking for, so it’s back to the drawing board…</p>

<h3 id="this-one-is-just-right">This one is just right</h3>

<p>After a broader search, we came upon the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pg_trgm</code> module that adds <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/pgtrgm.html">Trigram similarity</a> to PostgreSQL.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A trigram is a group of three consecutive characters taken from a string. We can measure the similarity of two strings by counting the number of trigrams they share. This simple idea turns out to be very effective for measuring the similarity of words in many natural languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds <strong>much</strong> more promising, let’s get to the query and see what results we get. Similar to the other two algorithms, we’ll have to add the module to PostgreSQL first by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;</code> in the PSQL console. From there, we can hop back to the query interface:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/9223335.js?file=trigram.sql"></script>

<p>We’ve got results that match up to our use case. A search for “hazienda” matches first to the brand named “Hacienda”, and then to some other sensible results. Perfect!</p>

<p>Now we just need to step back into our Rails API server and get this query running. That should be easy, right?</p>

<h3 id="the-bears-came-home-and-they-were-upset">The bears came home, and they were upset</h3>

<p>Perhaps incorrectly, our first instinct was to try and avoid reinventing the wheel. So we did some searching for reputable gems that wrap the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pg_trgm</code> module’s Trigram search functionality and came across <a href="https://github.com/textacular/textacular">textacular</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search">pg_search</a>.</p>

<p>If you couldn’t tell from the section header, some things went wrong here, but before we get into that let me say that both of these gems are awesome. They’ve got test coverage, quality metrics, semantic versioning, multiple contributors, etc. In short, they’ve got all the indicators of healthy, vibrant repositories.</p>

<p>That said, let’s talk about what went wrong. Of the two gems, textacular is much more straightforward (though not as feature rich) and has all the functionality we want. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">fuzzy_search</code> finder it adds is perfect, we should just be able to call from our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Brand</code> model like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Brand.fuzzy_search(name: 'hazienda').limit(10)</code> and we should get our Trigram similarity matches.</p>

<p>The catch is, textacular adds in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clause that was incompatible with our use case. The clause they put in makes sure the fuzzy search term is a substring in the column before running the similarity match. This is probably a performance optimization for large tables and complex combination queries, but for our purposes the raw query was fast enough and the substring match killed our ability to catch spelling mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="goldilocks-made-her-own-porridge">Goldilocks made her own porridge</h3>

<p>In the end, we decided to roll our own. Following one of the <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/">wonderful model refactoring patterns from Code Climate</a> (#4), we extracted it as a query object:</p>

    <p>I recently followed <a href="http://blogs.burnsidedigital.com/2013/09/and-httpbackend-mock-for-all-unit-e2e-testings/">this awesome blog post</a> to mock $httpBackend for my end-to-end tests.

<!--

<h3 id="conditionally-inject-e2e-mocks">Conditionally inject e2e-mocks</h3>

<p>The Burnside Digital blog post suggests including the following script in your application’s index.html.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ztbrown/7215173.js"></script>

<p>Karma’s end-to-end tests open your application in an iFrame. To conditionally inject the mocked $httpBackend, we can check to see if we are in an iFrame and only include e2e-mocks if we are.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ztbrown/7215241.js"></script>

<p>Now, when developing, you can work with your development server and when testing you can use mocked data.</p>

    <p>If you’re doing database seeding in a rails app through <code class="highlighter-rouge">seeds.rb</code> you might be interested in this snippet, especially if you’re
using CSV files to help you do it.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="mo-rows-mo-problems">Mo Rows, Mo Problems</h3>

<p>A couple of our recent projects have had rather large CSV files that need to be seeded. Running a <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:seed</code> command
takes an agonizing couple of minutes (several of the files have tens of thousands of rows). To help soothe our neurotic impulses
to kill the process midway through we decided to have a bit of fun sprucing up the console feedback while the seeding
is underway.</p>

<p>We started out with a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">puts "Seeding Models..."</code>, but that really doesn’t tell you anything about how many more models
need to be seeded. We decided to take a page out of the UNIX playbook and give the user a bit more information.</p>

<h3 id="the-unix-way">The UNIX way</h3>

<p>There’s a nifty utility named <code class="highlighter-rouge">wget</code> in UNIX that will let you download things given a URL. It gives you a nice visual
representation of the progress in the console using a text-based progress bar that looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>vagrant@lucid64:~$ wget https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png
--2012-12-01 04:59:29--  https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png
Resolving www.google.com... 173.194.75.99, 173.194.75.147, 173.194.75.106, ...

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>With a bit of digging, we found the <code class="highlighter-rouge">\r</code> special character for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">print</code> method, which allows you to do some UNIX-style magic in
updating what you’ve already printed to the console. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">\r</code> character will clear the current line of the display in the console.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4179185.js?file=genre.rb"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4179185.js?file=genres.csv"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4179185.js?file=seeds.rb"></script>

<p>Running a <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:seed</code> will now give you live progress updates:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>vagrant@lucid64:/vagrant$ rake db:seed
Seeding Genre:

</code></pre>

<p>Ah, much better!</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong>
Thanks to <a href="/2012/05/01/vagrants-and-chefs-and-librarians-oh-my/#comment-677428811">SDude</a>, <a href="/2012/05/01/vagrants-and-chefs-and-librarians-oh-my/#comment-584010225">zibuki</a>, <a href="/2012/05/01/vagrants-and-chefs-and-librarians-oh-my/#comment-537553234">bilke</a>, and <a href="/2012/05/01/vagrants-and-chefs-and-librarians-oh-my/#comment-521570237">Anthony Goddard</a> for helping to keep this post up-to-date and working.</p>

<p>For those of you out there doing development, you’ve probably run into some or all of the following problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your development environment doesn’t mirror your production environment.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult or impossible to keep everyone’s development environment consistent in multi-developer projects.</li>
  <li>You can never remember how to get all the configuration nuances right for whatever dependencies your project requires.</li>
  <li>It takes real, significant amounts of time to get yourself ready to go when starting or switching projects.</li>
  <li>The dependencies of one project might conflict with another project.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues kill your productivity with time-consuming and difficult-to-isolate issues that have <em>nothing</em> to do with the problem you actually want to solve. To get around these issues and give ourselves some other advantages (more on that later) we’re using a gem called <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to create a portable development environment.</p>

<!--

<h3 id="a-vagrants-life">A Vagrant’s life</h3>

<p>Vagrant is essentially a command-line wrapper on top of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle’s VirtualBox</a>. This lets you initialize, suspend, resume, and destroy virtual machines right from your terminal easily. Getting started is as easy as:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2564740.js?file=vagrant"></script>

<p>For a more detailed setup guide, check the <a href="http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html">Getting Started</a> documentation for Vagrant.</p>

<p>So with a nice, fresh virtual machine to play with, we can go ahead and setup all the things we need in our development environment. We can even do our best to mirror our production environment so we can avoid all those “it worked on my machine” issues.</p>

<p>But we’re still left with a problem, this virtual machine isn’t <em>portable</em>. If someone else joins the project, they’ll have to go through whatever manual setup steps we did to get the dependencies installed on their own Vagrant box.</p>

<p>Not to worry though, Vagrant has the perfect solution for you: <a href="http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/provisioning.html">Provisioning</a>. Provisioning allows you to automate the setup of your development environment using either <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/">Puppet</a> or <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home">Chef</a>. Based on our research, Chef seemed like the right way to go.</p>

<h3 id="the-chef-and-the-librarian">The Chef and the Librarian</h3>

<p>Chef is a provisioning tool, and as you might expect it makes it possible to automatically configure a machine (virtual or otherwise) into a specific state. In keeping with the culinary metaphor Chef has <em>recipes</em> which represent a specific configuration (e.g.: setting up an Apache server). Recipes are organized into <em>cookbooks</em>, which are really just containers for all those configuration options.</p>

<p>There’s a mountain of technical detail involved in Chef, it can be used to mainain an entire cloud infrastructure. To keep things simple, and within our abilities, we’re going to be focusing on a use of Chef called <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo">Chef Solo</a>.</p>

<p>When you looked at the Vagrant <a href="http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/provisioning.html">Getting Started documentation for Provisioning</a> you might have noticed the following use of Chef Solo to provision their sample box:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2564740.js?file=Vagrantfile-Getting-Started"></script>

<p>This kind of usage is great for a “Hello World” example, but not so great for showing you how to use Chef  Solo to provision in a more realistic context. We ran into some stumbling blocks with Chef Solo: How do we manage the cookbooks and recipes properly? Should we install them in the user directory? The project directory? How do we ensure everyone is using the same version?</p>

<p>At some point in our search for sanity in that process we ran across a great gem called <a href="https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian">Librarian</a> that aims to solve this exact problem. To setup Librarian for our project we need to run the following commands:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2564740.js?file=librarian"></script>

<p>What you’re doing there is ignoring a few folders in git and initializing the project for Librarian. Part of that initialization is to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cheffile</code> which serves as your way to define what cookbooks/recipes you need in a clean and portable way.</p>

<p>To set the stage a bit, let’s say we’re starting a Ruby on Rails project and we know we’re going to need the following things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An up-to-date system (through <code class="highlighter-rouge">aptitude</code>)</li>
  <li>Ruby (through <code class="highlighter-rouge">rvm</code>)</li>
  <li>Git (through <code class="highlighter-rouge">git-core</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not the most complicated set of requirements, but sufficient for getting this project off the ground. Let’s take a look at a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cheffile</code> that gets us the recipes we need:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2564740.js?file=Cheffile"></script>

<p>After we’ve set that, we simply run <code class="highlighter-rouge">librarian-chef install</code> to have Librarian pull down all those cookbooks and install them into our project. Now we just need to setup Vagrant to provision our environment:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2564740.js?file=Vagrantfile"></script>

<p>Pretty straight-forward stuff there, we’re just telling Vagrant to provision using Chef Solo, telling it where to find our cookbooks, and which recipes to use. After we’ve got those changes in place, we run <code class="highlighter-rouge">vagrant up</code> to have Vagrant initialize and provision our virtual machine.</p>

<p>At this point, you should be able to <code class="highlighter-rouge">vagrant ssh</code> into your box and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby -v</code> to confirm that everything went as planned. Vagrant will also yell at you during the provisioning phase if something about the process didn’t go according to plan.</p>

<h3 id="the-finale">The finale</h3>

<p>So what have we really accomplished here? Well, we’ve created a simple, automated, and portable way for you to setup all the dependencies for your project <em>without</em> cluttering your system. No more “works on my system”, no more cross-contamination from projects. And if you’re on Windows now, no more “only supported on *nix” frustrations. Let’s take a look at what a new developer coming onto the project would need to do to get setup:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2564740.js?file=finale"></script>

<p>Take a moment to look at that…</p>

<h3 id="four-commands">Four. Commands.</h3>

<p>Four commands and you’ve checkout out the project from version control and setup a clean, fully provisioned, and isolated virtual machine to do your development in.</p>

<p>As you can see, Vagrant, Chef, and Librarian make a seriously powerful addition to your development arsenal. As such, there’s a lot more things you can do with them; here’s some links to get you started:</p>

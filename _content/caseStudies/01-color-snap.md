## Color Snap Visualizer

As a leader in the paint industry, Sherwin-Williams wanted to create a tool worthy of their products - something to get customers excited about paint. Our developers worked with their marketing department and a team of designers to bring to life an application that does just that.

The result is a cross-platform application that allows users to actively engage in the process of choosing paint colors for their home by uploading and adding paint to their own photos, all while discovering the many collections available from Sherwin-Williams.

Delivering inspiration to desktops and phones, the application provides a true digital representation of the Sherwin-Williams paint library and is used by millions of potential customers and painting professionals regularly.

## ScopeBuilder

Throughout this multi-phase project, we worked with AEPâ€™s subject matter experts in a series of requirement gathering, wireframe creation, development, and testing stages. Feedback was provided, prioritized, and applied early and often. We delivered functional software at every step of the process.

The resulting application is a single, consistent interface designed to be used by many distinct and important engineering and business units.

Not only did this project result in an efficient and useful application, its creation process encouraged greater cross-department collaboration and inspired the client to improve their offline processes.

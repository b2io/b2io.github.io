## Battery XT

Throughout the process of gathering requirements, creating design concepts, development, and testing, we collaborated with our counterparts at DNV GL headquarters in Norway. Working with their engineering and marketing departments we talked through several rounds of brainstorming and design concepts before arriving at the final concept.

The result was a web application that delivers an interactive experience on any size and type of device.

Not only did the final application result in a completely responsive, mobile-friendly demo of the product, it also served as a portal for capturing leads and providing more information.

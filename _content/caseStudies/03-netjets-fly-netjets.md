## Fly NetJets

Working closely with the stakeholders and subject-matter experts at NetJets, we created an intuitive, polished native application for clients of their high-end flight services.

By leveraging the power of the React Native platform, we created one codebase that can easily be compiled into both iOS and Android applications and submitted to their respective app stores. The streamlined codebase is thoughtfully written to optimize maintainability and will be easy to expand as functionality is added to meet the needs of both NetJets and their clients.

The resulting application provides an elegant and effortless experience that puts flight scheduling, inflight dining orders, and the entire booking process right at the user’s fingertips.

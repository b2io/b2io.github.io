This morning during our weekly meeting, I came up with an idea to facilitate our
twenty percent time / new product brainstorming. We often find ourselves
explaining our ideas by comparing them to existing products or services.
StumbleUpon + LinkedIn. Google Glass meets Nike+ meets Yelp, etc.

I spent a couple hours this afternoon and got a working proof of concept! It was
such a rewarding thing to go from concept to finished product so quickly!

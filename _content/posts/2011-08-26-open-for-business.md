We are proud to announce that Base Two Interactive, a creative digital agency
based in Columbus, Ohio, co-founded by former Clutch Interactive employees
Andrew Miller and Zack Brown, has officially opened for business. Our team has
delivered innovative digital content for agencies, local businesses, and
multinational companies, including McGraw-Hill, Home Depot, Wendy’s, Cardinal
Health, Limited Brands, Donatos, The Ohio State University, Resource
Interactive, and Mills James.

Developing interactive experiences is our passion. We leverage Flash, Flex, AIR,
and HTML5 to deliver engaging content for the web and desktop, tablets and
mobile devices, kiosks and digital signage. Our attention to detail and deep
understanding of software architecture and best practices enables us to
consistently deliver for our clients.

We take a lot of pride in our work. We also take a lot of pride in where we
work. Our offices are located at ~~1158 Corrugated Way~~ (our new location is 21
E. 5th Ave #102, Columbus, OH 43201), in the brand-new tech wing of the Columbus
Idea Foundry, our business development partner. The Columbus Idea Foundry is
Columbus’s own community workshop, DIY learning center, creative space, and
small business incubator. We are very excited to have the opportunity to
collaborate with The Columbus Idea Foundry and its member businesses.

We are always looking for opportunities to make creative, interactive content.

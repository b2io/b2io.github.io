Iâ€™ve had to set up a Windows development environment three times so far, and each time I've been confused by some of the options. I'm hoping this will serve as a quick reference guide the next time someone (or my future self) needs to set up a Windows machine.

On Windows I've gone through a few approaches trying to get the terminal features I've grown to like from working on Linux and macOS. At first I was using ConEmu, but this time I've switched to Zeit's [Hyper](https://hyper.is/). It's running PowerShell, and I've set up [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/), which is similar to `oh-my-zsh`.

### VS Code

I've switched from Atom editor to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). (When I first wrote this post I was still using Atom.) Atom is slow for me on Windows, and I've found VS Code to be snappy and lightweight.

Here's my list of extensions:

```bash
$ code --list-extensions
abusaidm.html-snippets
AureliaEffect.aurelia
CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer
daylerees.rainglow
dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
EditorConfig.EditorConfig
esbenp.prettier-vscode
formulahendry.auto-rename-tag
jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components
mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel
ms-python.python
ms-vscode.csharp
PKief.material-icon-theme
Shan.code-settings-sync
shinnn.stylelint
```

I also set up a few hotkeys from Sublime/Atom, Fira Code font, and adjusted some settings to reduce the visual clutter I was experiencing. Here's a gist of [my full settings](https://gist.github.com/reeddunkle/fbac96684c415179f663327a3fa8815c).

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Installing Git for Windows seems to confuse me a little each time. For the record, this time I went with all of the default options except for these two:

![Add Git and Unix tools to PATH](https://i.imgur.com/bGnq17k.png)

> The more Unix tools the better, I think?

![Checkout as-is; Commit as-is](https://i.imgur.com/69sYWJd.png)

> Assume that someone else is controlling for this. I don't want my local environment to convert our project files.

### [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

After you install Hyper, open it once to ensure that it generates its config file.

#### PowerShell

Open Hyper's config file `~/.hyper.js` in an editor. Search for the key `shell: ...`. By default it's set to the Cmd shell (or an empty string). First, I changed my shell value to my PowerShell path. Second, I had to remove `'--login'` from my `shellArgs` (but the array at least needs to contain an empty string). Here are the two changes I made:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  config: {
    // Edit these two:
    shell: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe',
    shellArgs: [''],
  },
};
```

Note that the path to your `powershell.exe` could be different.

#### Set default directory

If you want new tabs (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`t`) to point to your current working directory, you can use the Hyper plugin [hypercwd](https://github.com/hharnisc/hypercwd). In your `.hyper.js` file, under the `config: { ... }` settings, there's a `plugins` array. Add `'hypercwd'`.

_**Update (5/14/18):** `hypercwd` is currently working, but was breaking over the last few weeks. Remove it from your list of plugins if you run into issues._

```javascript
module.exports = {
  config: { ... },
  plugins: ['hypercwd'],
};
```

You'll have to restart Hyper for the plugin to work.

If you only want to change the default directory, you can do it through PowerShell. In your terminal navigate to your Documents folder (by default mine was `C:\Users\reed\Documents`). Find or create the `WindowsPowerShell` directory and move into it. Run this to create a profile config: `touch profile.ps1` and open it in an editor. Add this line, but change the path to your desired default directory:

```
Set-Location C:\Users\...
```

Save the file and restart Hyper.

Note that this PowerShell setting seems to load after hypercwd, so they don't both work. The first solution is good enough for my purposes, though.

### [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#installation/)

Follow the instructions in the README above. As a guideline, this is what I did:

1.  [Verify that I have all of the prerequisites](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#prerequisites). Note that I had to open Hyper as Administrator for some of these.
1.  [Install posh-git via PowerShellGet](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#installing-posh-git-via-powershellget)
1.  [Configure my PowerShell session to use the posh-git module](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#using-posh-git)

Their README lists three steps to complete the above last step. Here's what I did:

* Step 1: I ran the command they have listed.
* Step 2: I ran the `Add-PoshGitToProfile` to have PowerShell load posh-git with every session, but I didn't do the "AllHosts" thing yet. I'll update this if that changes.
* Step 3: I skipped this.

#### Connect to GitHub using SSH through Posh-Git

First, I followed GitHub's steps to [Generate a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key) for this computer.

Next, moving on to [add my new key to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), I skipped their first step, and instead ran the Posh-Git command: `Start-SshAgent`. Then I moved on to their second step and ran: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

Finally, I [added the new key to my GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).

### Final thoughts

I think part of the reason that I've found the Windows setup more confusing is because I'm prompted to make more decisions. Hopefully this reference guide works as a sort of user script to help streamline the installation process. I'll keep this up-to-date, so please ping me in the comments (@rdunkle) if you catch anything that I should change.

Thanks for reading!

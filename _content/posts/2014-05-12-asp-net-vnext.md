Scott Hanselman just wrote a blog entry about what's next for ASP.NET (vNext).
The [article](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingASPNETVNext.aspx) has
pretty pictures and is worth a read, but if you're too busy to read it here are
the things that stood out to me.

* `packages.config`, `nuspec`, and project files (`csproj`) merged into a
  unified view of project dependencies expressed as `project.json`
* The ability to patch open source libraries with a simple override folder
* “No-compile compile” - i.e. The ability to update a C# class and refresh the
  browser to see the change without needing to recompile the project
* ASP.NET MVC and Web API unified into a single programming model
* Dependency injection out of the box

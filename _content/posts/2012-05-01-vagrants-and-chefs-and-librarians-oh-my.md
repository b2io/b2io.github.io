up-to-date and working.

For those of you out there doing development, you've probably run into some or
all of the following problems:

- Your development environment doesn't mirror your production environment.
- It's difficult or impossible to keep everyone's development environment
  consistent in multi-developer projects.
- You can never remember how to get all the configuration nuances right for
  whatever dependencies your project requires.
- It takes real, significant amounts of time to get yourself ready to go when
  starting or switching projects.
- The dependencies of one project might conflict with another project.

These issues kill your productivity with time-consuming and difficult-to-isolate
issues that have _nothing_ to do with the problem you actually want to solve. To
get around these issues and give ourselves some other advantages (more on that
later) we're using a gem called [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) to create a
portable development environment.

## A Vagrant's life

Vagrant is essentially a command-line wrapper on top of
[Oracle's VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/). This lets you initialize,
suspend, resume, and destroy virtual machines right from your terminal easily.
Getting started is as easy as:

```
$ vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box
$ vagrant init lucid32
$ vagrant up
```

For a more detailed setup guide, check the
[Getting Started](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html)
documentation for Vagrant.

So with a nice, fresh virtual machine to play with, we can go ahead and setup
all the things we need in our development environment. We can even do our best
to mirror our production environment so we can avoid all those "it worked on my
machine" issues.

But we're still left with a problem, this virtual machine isn't _portable_. If
someone else joins the project, they'll have to go through whatever manual setup
steps we did to get the dependencies installed on their own Vagrant box.

Not to worry though, Vagrant has the perfect solution for you:
[Provisioning](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/provisioning.html).
Provisioning allows you to automate the setup of your development environment
using either [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/) or
[Chef](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home). Based on our research, Chef
seemed like the right way to go.

## The Chef and the Librarian

Chef is a provisioning tool, and as you might expect it makes it possible to
automatically configure a machine (virtual or otherwise) into a specific state.
In keeping with the culinary metaphor Chef has _recipes_ which represent a
specific configuration (e.g.: setting up an Apache server). Recipes are
organized into _cookbooks_, which are really just containers for all those
configuration options.

There's a mountain of technical detail involved in Chef, it can be used to
mainain an entire cloud infrastructure. To keep things simple, and within our
abilities, we're going to be focusing on a use of Chef called
[Chef Solo](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo).

When you looked at the Vagrant
[Getting Started documentation for Provisioning](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/provisioning.html)
you might have noticed the following use of Chef Solo to provision their sample
box:

```
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "lucid32"

  # Enable and configure the chef solo provisioner
  config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|
    # We're going to download our cookbooks from the web
    chef.recipe_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/getting_started/cookbooks.tar.gz"

    # Tell chef what recipe to run. In this case, the `vagrant_main` recipe
    # does all the magic.
    chef.add_recipe("vagrant_main")
  end
end
```

This kind of usage is great for a "Hello World" example, but not so great for
showing you how to use Chef Solo to provision in a more realistic context. We
ran into some stumbling blocks with Chef Solo: How do we manage the cookbooks
and recipes properly? Should we install them in the user directory? The project
directory? How do we ensure everyone is using the same version?

At some point in our search for sanity in that process we ran across a great gem
called [Librarian](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian) that aims to
solve this exact problem. To setup Librarian for our project we need to run the
following commands:

```
$ gem install librarian
$ echo cookbooks >> .gitignore
$ echo tmp >> .gitignore
$ librarian-chef init
```

What you're doing there is ignoring a few folders in git and initializing the
project for Librarian. Part of that initialization is to create a `Cheffile`
which serves as your way to define what cookbooks/recipes you need in a clean
and portable way.

To set the stage a bit, let's say we're starting a Ruby on Rails project and we
know we're going to need the following things:

- An up-to-date system (through `aptitude`)
- Ruby (through `rvm`)
- Git (through `git-core`)

Not the most complicated set of requirements, but sufficient for getting this
project off the ground. Let's take a look at a `Cheffile` that gets us the
recipes we need:

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
#^syntax detection

site 'http://community.opscode.com/api/v1'

cookbook 'apt'
cookbook 'git', 
  git: 'https://github.com/fnichol/chef-git.git'
cookbook 'build-essential'
cookbook 'rvm', 
  git: 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm.git', ref: 'v0.8.6'
```

After we've set that, we simply run `librarian-chef install` to have Librarian
pull down all those cookbooks and install them into our project. Now we just
need to setup Vagrant to provision our environment:

```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "lucid64"
  config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid64.box"
  config.vm.network :hostonly, "33.33.33.10"

  config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|
    chef.cookbooks_path = ["cookbooks"]
    chef.add_recipe "apt"
    chef.add_recipe "build-essential"
    chef.add_recipe "rvm::vagrant"
    chef.add_recipe "rvm::system"
    chef.add_recipe "git"
  end
end
```
Pretty straight-forward stuff there, we're just telling Vagrant to provision
using Chef Solo, telling it where to find our cookbooks, and which recipes to
use. After we've got those changes in place, we run `vagrant up` to have Vagrant
initialize and provision our virtual machine.

At this point, you should be able to `vagrant ssh` into your box and run `ruby -v` to confirm that everything went as planned. Vagrant will also yell at you
during the provisioning phase if something about the process didn't go according
to plan.

### The finale

So what have we really accomplished here? Well, we've created a simple,
automated, and portable way for you to setup all the dependencies for your
project _without_ cluttering your system. No more "works on my system", no more
cross-contamination from projects. And if you're on Windows now, no more "only
supported on \*nix" frustrations. Let's take a look at what a new developer
coming onto the project would need to do to get setup:

```
$ git clone <your_git_repository_url>
$ cd <repository_name>
$ librarian-chef install
$ vagrant up
```

Take a moment to look at that...

### Four. Commands.

Four commands and you've checkout out the project from version control and setup
a clean, fully provisioned, and isolated virtual machine to do your development
in.

As you can see, Vagrant, Chef, and Librarian make a seriously powerful addition
to your development arsenal. As such, there's a lot more things you can do with
them; here's some links to get you started:

  detail on how you can use Vagrant to setup virtual development environments.
- [Chef Solo Wiki](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo) -- more
  detail on how you can use Chef Solo to provision your Vagrant box.
- [Librarian README](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian/blob/master/README.md)
  -- more detail on how you can use Librarian to manage your chef cookbooks and
  recipes.

  behind Chef maintains this repository of cookbooks.

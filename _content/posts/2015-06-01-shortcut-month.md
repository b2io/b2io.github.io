Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to improve your overall efficiency with your
computer, but they can be difficult to commit to memory all at once. This month
we will suggest a new shortcut each day that we find helpful in our day-to-day
lives as front-end web developers. By learning a new shortcut each day you will
be well on your way to living a mouse-free life.

## Preface

I do much of my day-to-day work on a Windows 7 machine using WebStorm, Visual
Studio 2013, and Google Docs. As such, this list of keyboard shortcuts may not
be as helpful to users of different platforms and software, though there are
generally similar shortcuts available on those systems.

### 6/1 Move windows in Windows

I find the ability to manipulate the position of windows via the keyboard in
Windows 7 as one of the greatest features the OS offers - yet many users somehow
overlook this simple set of shortcuts. By holding the Windows key and using your
keyboard arrow keys you'll no longer need your mouse to move the active window.

| Key combination                         | Result      |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| win + left-arrow  | Split left  |
| win + right-arrow | Split right |
| win + up-arrow    | Maximize    |
| win + down-arrow  | Minimize    |

Also, if you have multiple monitors, you can move the window from monitor to
monitor by continuing to click the left or right arrow key while holding down
the Windows key.

### 6/2: Move that cursor

Until you learn these simple cursor management shortcuts you likely won't
realize how much time you've wasted using your mouse to move the cursor and
select words in word documents. Once these are committed to muscle memory you'll
be able to type and edit documents like a pro.

You likely already know that the arrow keys can be used to move the cursor, and
you may know that holding the shift key while arrowing allows you to select a
character at a time. From there you simply need to remember that the
ctrl key can be used as a modifier to do things in larger chunks.

| Left Key combination                    | Result                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| left-arrow                   | move cursor left                                                |
| ctrl + left-arrow | move cursor left to the beginning of the word                   |
| home                         | move cursor left to the beginning of the line                   |
| ctrl + home       | move cursor to the beginning of the document (super-duper left) |
| shift + key combo            | select text between cursor start and end point                  |

| Right Key combination                    | Result                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| right-arrow                   | move cursor right                                          |
| ctrl + right-arrow | move cursor right to the end of the word                   |
| end                           | move cursor right to the end of the line                   |
| ctrl + end         | move cursor to the end of the document (super-duper right) |
| shift + key combo             | select text between cursor start and end point             |

### 6/3: Google Docs - Shortcut for everything

Have you ever been working in a Google Doc and wanted to add a numeric list
(ctrl + shift + 7), a bulleted list
(ctrl + shift + 8), or perhaps center the text
(ctrl + shift + E)? You likely reached for your
mouse and visually scanned the format bar for these features because it's too
difficult to remember the individual shortcuts (or there isn't a shortcut at all
as in the case of changing the font). Well, you're in luck. There's a single
magical shortcut that does it all.

| Key combination               | Result                             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| alt + / | search the menu within Google Docs |

This simple key combination allows you to search the menu options. So, if you
want to change the font to "Courier New" you can hit alt +
/, type "cour", and hit enter.

![Google Docs search menu](https://i.imgur.com/myyRI6w.png)

Generally the individual shortcut for each feature is still faster, but a
shortcut that you can remember is better than one you cannot. Plus, when you use
the alt + / key combination it will show you the shortcut
combination to the right of the option before you apply it - so you have a way
to learn the more granular ones over time. If you'd like to learn all of the
shortcut keys available in Google Docs there's a shortcut for that too:
ctrl + /.

### 6/4: Super pasting powers

Often times adding shift to a keyboard shortcut changes or enhances
the shortcut. Most people know that ctrl + v will paste
whatever was copied to the clipboard, but many applications offer an enhanced
paste with ctrl + shift + v.

| Key combination                                   | Result                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + shift + v | Paste without formatting (Google Docs / Microsoft Word), Select from clipboard (Web Storm, Visual Studio) |

In Google Docs and Microsoft Word using ctrl + shift +
v acts as "paste special". This allows you to paste the clipboard
contents in the document's format rather than the originally copied format. For
example, if you copy bold Comic Sans text from a web page, and then paste into
your Arial Google Doc with ctrl + v, it will paste in bold
Comic Sans (which you clearly don't want because you're not a monster); however,
if you were to paste with ctrl + shift + v it
will paste the text content from the website in the matching Arial font style
and size.

In IDEs, such as Web Storm and Visual Studio, ctrl +
shift + v allows you to paste previously copied text. In
Web Storm ctrl + shift + v will provide a
window to select which of the previously copied texts to paste.

![WebStorm paste special](https://i.imgur.com/9a65jrl.png)

Visual Studio will progressively paste the next most recently copied item with
each ctrl + shift + v click (while holding
ctrl + shift). In both applications ctrl +
v will paste the most recently copied text.

Copy this post (ctrl + c) and give it a try!

### 6/5: Lock it down

Before heading out of the office for lunch (or just going to the bathroom) you
should probably lock your computer. Rather than reaching for your mouse and
meandering over to the start button, learn this simple shortcut.

| Key combination               | Result                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| win + l | Lock screen (in Windows) |

win + l (l for lock) will immediately lock your Windows
screen.

Now you can go to the bathroom with the peace of mind that nobody will replace
you
[desktop background](http://www.wikihow.com/Pull-a-Computer-Prank-on-Your-Friends).

### 6/6: Show me the Desktop

It's the weekend and you want to see that pretty desktop image of yours rather
than all of the work-related applications and windows. Windows 7 has the nifty
little feature that allows you to minimize everything and go straight to your
desktop by clicking on the very bottom right of the screen, but that approach is
for mouse-lovers, who we are not.

| Key combination               | Result                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| win + d | Show desktop (and minimize all windows) in Windows |

win + d (d for desktop) will take you straight to your
desktop without ever glancing at your mouse. If you want to bring all of your
applications back up simply hit win + d again.

### 6/7: One-handed Browser Tab Management

At times you may find yourself browsing the web and you think of something
different that you want to search for. Many people may click the "add tab"
button toward the top of the browser, but that would require touching the mouse
and moving it several millimeters up. With just your left hand you can quickly
open a new tab and start typing your search.

| Key combination                                     | Result                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + t                      | Create new tab                                                                     |
| ctrl + w                      | Close tab or application (Browsers, Windows Explorer, and many other applications) |
| ctrl + shift + t   | Re-open closed tab                                                                 |
| ctrl + tab                    | Switch to next tab to the right                                                    |
| ctrl + shift + tab | Switch to next tab to the left                                                     |

ctrl + t will open a new tab in most browsers, and will
place the focus in the address bar so that you can immediately begin typing your
search (at least in Chrome, which is the browser you should be using). When
you're done with the tab you can close it with ctrl + w (w
for close?).

ctrl + tab will allow you to quickly switch to the tab to
the right. Adding shift to the close or move right shortcuts will reverse their
behavior thereby re-opening the closed tab or moving to the tab on the left (oh
the magic of the shift key).

Now you're able to create, switch, and remove browser tabs all with just your
left hand, which frees your right hand to throw your mouse across the room.

### 6/8: Spreadsheet Column/Row Selection

It's Monday and you're back to work. If you find yourself modifying spreadsheets
for even a portion of the day then it's worthwhile learning some common
shortcuts. Today we'll go over how to select columns and rows without using the
mouse.

![Select column](https://i.imgur.com/x3gocRv.png)

| Key combination                     | Result                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + space  | Select column (Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel) |
| shift + space | Select row (Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel)    |

In both Google Spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel you can use ctrl +
space to select the column of the active cell (ctrl for
**C**olumn). This is helpful when you want to clear the contents of the column
(by clicking delete), draw your attention to the column, or act on
the column in some other way (we'll go over column insertion and removal in a
future post). You can then use shift and arrow keys to select more
columns.

If rows are more your thing then you can use shift + space
to select a row (shift for "**S**ooo not a column").

### 6/9: Spreadsheet Column/Row Insert and Delete

With yesterday's shortcut you now know how to select a column or row in a
spreadsheet. Now it's time to learn how to do two of the most popular
spreadsheet actions: insertion and deletion.

Sadly this is an area where Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet shortcuts
differ. We'll go over Excel shortcuts first.

| Excel Key combination          | Result                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + + | Add column(s) or row(s) above or to the left of the selected column(s) or row(s) |
| ctrl + - | Remove selected column(s) or row(s)                                              |

In Excel you first must select the column(s) or row(s) that you wish to act on.
Then you can use ctrl + + to add columns or rows or
ctrl + - to remove columns or rows. When adding columns or
rows it inserts the same number of columns or rows that you have selected either
left of the selected columns or above the selected rows.

| Google Spreadsheet Key combination           | Result                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| alt + i + c | Add column(s) to the left of the selected column(s) |
| alt + i + r | Add row(s) above the selected row(s)                |
| alt + e + d | Remove selected column(s) or row(s)                 |

Since the column and row shortcuts found in Excel are already browser shortcuts
used to zoom in and out (note: if you accidentally zoomed in or out you can use
ctrl + 0 to return to 100%), Google had to come up with
different, less obvious, shortcuts. It is not necessary to select the column or
row before using the insertion shortcuts, but by selecting more than one column
or row the insertion action will insert the number that is selected.

The insertion shortcuts are alt + i + c for
"**I**nsert **C**olumn" and alt + i + r for
"**I**nsert **R**ow". Column and row deletion is alt + e +
d for "**E**dit **D**elete".

### 6/10: Jump to the Address Bar

All too often users shift their mouse to the top of the screen simply to place
their cursor in the browser address bar. Cut that bad habit with this simple
shortcut.

![Browser address bar](https://i.imgur.com/wC5hjP9.png)

| Key combination               | Result                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| alt + d | Place cursor in address bar (all browsers and Windows Explorer) |

When in a browser or Windows folder (Windows Explorer) pressing alt +
d will place focus in the address bar, and highlight the contents of
the address bar so that you can immediately begin typing. This is also helpful
when you want to copy the address of the page you are on via ctrl +
c.

**Pro tip:** Add a ? at the beginning of you address bar to force a
Google search rather than it potentially being treated as a url as is the case
when you search for "asp.net".

### 6/11: Switch Active Windows

This one is an oldie and a goodie. Many people already know and use this
shortcut without even thinking about it, but for anybody who doesn't already
know how to switch between applications this shortcut is a life changer.

| Key combination                 | Result                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| alt + tab | Switch between open applications and windows |

If you have multiple applications open you can switch between them with
alt + tab rather than clicking on the taskbar icons with
your mouse. Using this keyboard combination will switch you to the most recently
used application. If you press the combination again it will switch you back. If
you press alt + tab but keep holding down the
alt key you will see a list of the applications to switch between,
and while holding alt it will switch the selected application for
each press of the tab key.

### 6/12: Back and Forward Navigation

When browsing the web you will inevitably need to navigate backward - whether
it's to get back to your search results or to return to an embarrassingly
[cute picture](http://api.ning.com/files/OQbVc*b-KB9N8WhlPa*p43ZhR5D2*6BzUXEABZ-BvbE*si9pe31-k6QHTC6RP0wiV1YKvbHXTJCadfhxHgVI9CDC4JZ*vNiK/cutedog1920x1200.jpg)
 that you stumbled upon. You're in luck - there's a shortcut for
that.

![Browser navigation](https://i.imgur.com/VMZT1KD.png)

| Key combination                         | Result                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| alt + left-arrow  | Navigate back in browsers and Windows Explorer    |
| alt + right-arrow | Navigate forward in browsers and Windows Explorer |

Using alt and you're left and right arrow keys you can navigate your
browser history like a pro. This also works with Windows Explorer so you can
quickly open folders and navigate back all day. Note that backspace
and shift + backspace will also navigate backward /
forward assuming you're focus isn't in an input field, but the alt
key approach is convenient because it always works.

### 6/13: Facebook Stream Navigation

I'm sure you don't use Facebook at work, but now that it's the weekend it's fair
game. There's a better way to scroll through your stream than using the mouse or
arrow keys.

| Key combination | Result                                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| j    | Scroll to next post (Facebook, Google+, various other sites)     |
| k    | Scroll to previous post (Facebook, Google+, various other sites) |

Using the j key you can scroll down your social stream while sipping
on your weekend
[margarita](https://eytanuliel.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/giant-margarita.jpg).
If you skipped past something interesting click k. Be careful that
you don't have focus in an input field otherwise you're going to have a pretty
funny status update (jjjjjkjkjjk).

### 6/14: Browser Refresh

Web developers refresh their browser approximately 1337 times a day, but even
the average user occasionally needs to refresh.

| Key combination                                   | Result                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + r                    | Refresh the browser                                  |
| ctrl + shift + r | Refresh the browser ignoring cache (Chrome, Firefox) |

ctrl + r will refresh the browser as if you clicked the
browser refresh button. Chrome and Firefox also provide ctrl +
shift + r, which will reload the page and all of the
assets rather than relying on cached data. This comes in handy when you're a web
developer troubleshooting a problem.

Note that F5 and shift + F5 perform the same
refresh and refresh ignoring cache actions, but they're a bit more of a finger
stretch.

###  6/15: Folder and File Browsing

The most common (and slowest) way to browse folders and files is to double click
on My Computer, and then begin clicking and scrolling folders. Using a few
keyboard shortcuts will get you where you want to be in a snap.

| Key combination               | Result                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| win + e | Opens Windows Explorer (the equivalent of double clicking "My Computer") |
| win + r | Opens the Run window                                                     |

If you like starting at "My Computer" (labeled as just "Computer" in Windows 7)
then win + e is your new best friend. It opens the
Computer directory up immediately so that you can begin to navigate the folders.

![My computer](https://i.imgur.com/johmmCX.png)

Folders can be navigated quickly by arrowing down/up to the folder you wish to
open and then clicking enter. If you're staring at a long list of
folders then you can jump quickly to the folder you want by beginning to type
the name of the folder. If you've opened a folder by accident you can use the
navigate back shortcut that we learned previously
(alt + left-arrow). When you're done navigating you can
close the folder with ctrl + w as we learned in
One-handed Browser Tab Management.

If you prefer to start at a different folder than Computer you can use the run
command win + r and then type the folder you want to jump
to (such as c:/windows), and the click enter.

### 6/16: Rename Folder or File

Yesterday you learned how to navigate folders and files without a mouse, but if
you wanted to rename one of those folders or files you would still need to right
click with your mouse. No more! Today we learn the simple shortcut that allows
for renaming.

| Key combination | Result                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F2   | Rename file in Windows Explorer, edit cell in Microsoft Excel |

Yes, the function keys in the great north of your keyboard do have a purpose.
When browsing files and folders clicking F2 will put the selected
folder or file in rename mode with the full name already selected. Therefore if
you want to fully rename the folder or file you can just start typing. If,
instead, you only wanted to modify the name then after hitting F2 hit
arrow-right to remove the highlight.

### 6/17: New Browser Window

Occasionally you want a new browser window rather than a new tab - especially if
you plan to split screen or you are using multiple monitors. Before you drag
that new tab out of the window learn this shortcut.

| Key combination                                   | Result                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + n                    | Open new window (Browsers, Windows Explorer, varios applications) |
| ctrl + shift + n | Open new icognito window (Chrome)                                 |

Use ctrl + n to open a new window (**n** for **N**ew
window). This shortcut works similarly in various other applications. For
instance, ctrl + n will create a new document in Word and
a new tab in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

![Chrome incognito](https://i.imgur.com/AI7u4Ek.png)

If you're feeling a little sneakier you open a new Icognito window in Chrome via
ctrl + shift + n. Icognito mode allows your to
browse without storing history, cookies, etc. This is helpful if you're doing
web development or if you're buying your significant other a surprise gift.

### 6/18: Find What You're Looking For

When you're looking for a specific term on a web page or document the
application's search functionality can be a savior, but ironically the search
functionality can be difficult to find. Stop searching for the search so that
you can begin searching with these shortcuts.

![My computer](https://i.imgur.com/gTzjt7w.png)

| Key combination                  | Result                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + f   | Opens find in most applications and Windows Explorer |
| F3                    | Find next in most applications                       |
| shift + F3 | Find previous in most applications                   |

Next time there is a term you want to search for simply press ctrl +
f to be placed in the application's search form. You can then
generally begin typing your search (you may need to hit enter to submit it). If
there are multiple results you can go to the next result with F3, and
if you accidentally pass what you were looking for you can search backward with
shift + F3.

### 6/19: Start with the Win Key

The Windows 7 Start menu is fairly useful, but most people don't know the
shortcuts to take full advantage of it.

| Key combination                               | Result                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| win                                | Opens the start menu                                                 |
| win and then up-arrow   | Move selection up to "All Programs"                                  |
| win and then down-arrow | Move selection to the top item                                       |
| win and then tab        | Move selection to next section (right column, shutdown, left column) |
| win and then type                  | Search applications and files                                        |

Pressing the win key will open the Start menu. From there you can
immediately start typing to search for and open applications. For instance, if
you want to open Google Chrome you can generally hit win, type "ch",
and hit enter (you may need to type more than just "ch" depending on
your installed applications and how recently you've opened Chrome in this
manner).

Once the Start menu is open you can also use the arrow keys, tab, and
enter to navigate. The arrow keys will move up and down the current
column, tab will move you between the sections (right column,
shutdown, left column), and enter will open the currently selected
item.

So hit win and give it a try!

###  6/20: Create New Folder and More

If you organizing a lot of files, such as vacation images, you may find the need
to create one or more folders. Use this simple shortcut that you've already seen
before instead of using the mouse's right-click context menu.

| Key combination                                   | Result                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ctrl + shift + n | Create new folder (Windows Explorer) |

Like many shortcuts, ctrl + shift + n acts
differently depending on where it is used. We learned in the New
Browser Window post that it opens a new Incognito window in Google Chrome.
When used in Windows Explorer, ctrl + shift + n
creates a new folder with the name highlighted so that you can immediately begin
typing to rename the folder. With this shortcut you can quickly create multiple
folders without ever lifting your hands off of the keyboard.

Also remember that many other shortcuts that you likely are familiar with work
within Windows Explorer.

| Key combination                | Result                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + a | Select all file(s) and folder(s)          |
| ctrl + c | Copy selected file(s) and folder(s)       |
| ctrl + x | Cut selected file(s) and folder(s)        |
| ctrl + v | Paste copied or cut file(s) and folder(s) |
| ctrl + z | Undo (delete, paste, rename, etc.)        |
| delete              | Delete selected file(s) or folder(s)      |

###  6/21: Undo / Redo

Today is Father's Day so we'll keep this one short and sweet. We're all prone to
make mistakes (especially fathers suffering from sleep deprivation). That's why
it's worth mastering the art of undo and redo.

| Key combination                                   | Result                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ctrl + z                    | Undo                              |
| ctrl + shift + z | Redo                              |
| ctrl + y                    | Redo (additional shortcut option) |

If you make a mistake in a word document, browser field, Windows Explorer, or
almost any other application ctrl + z will reverse the
mistake. Think **Z** for
[**Z**orro](http://s.emuparadise.org/fup/up/95763-Zorro_(1995)_(1995)(Capstone_Software)-1.jpg)
cutting through your mistake. Most applications keep a list of changes so that
you can undo multiple times.

If after an undo you realize that the change was valid and you want to undo the
undo (aka redo) use the power of the shift key to reverse the
shortcut (ctrl + shift + z).

You can also access the redo functionality with ctrl + y
as in wh**Y** does this shortcut exist?

### 6/22: Print Screen and Window Capture

Occasionally you want to take a screenshot so that you can share what you're
looking at with another person, but is there a shortcut for that?

| Key combination                          | Result                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| print screen                  | Capture full screen onto clipboard     |
| alt + print screen | Capture selected window onto clipboard |

Pressing print screen will seem like it didn't do anything, but it
tells Windows to take a screenshot of the full screen and add it to your
clipboard. Once added to your clipboard you can use ctrl +
v to paste it into an email, word document, or any other application
that supports images. Just want to capture the current window rather than the
full screen? Add alt to the mix.

**Tip:** If you'd like to capture something smaller than the active window you
can use Windows 7's "Snipping Tool". Open it using the Start Menu shortcuts you
learned in [Start with the Win Key](#19).

### 6/23: Gmail Shortcuts

Gmail has a wealth of shortcuts, but you have to opt-in to use them. We'll
review some of the most useful shortcuts to coax you into opting-in.

With Gmail shortcuts turned on the following shortcuts (and
[many more](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/support/enterprise/static/gapps/learningcenter/Gmail-Keyboard-shortcuts.pdf) ) are now available to you:

| Key combination                             | Result                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| up-arrow / down-arrow | Move the focus up / down the inbox list |
| c                                | Compose new email                       |
| x                                | Check / uncheck the focused inbox item  |
| enter                            | Open the focused inbox item             |
| l                                | Label the opened or checked email(s)    |
| e                                | Archive the opened or checked email(s)  |
| #                                | Delete the opened or checked email(s)   |
| ctrl + k              | Insert link                             |
| ?                                | Show all shortcuts                      |

To opt-in to Gmail shortcuts:

1.  Open the desktop version of Gmail (on your computer not a mobile device).
2.  Click the gear icon in the upper right corner, and select **Settings**.
3.  Within the **Keyboard shortcuts** section select **Keyboard shortcuts on**.
4.  Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the screen.

### 6/24: Submit Post When Enter Doesn't Work

On many websites, such as Facebook, pressing enter will add a newline
rather than submit your post. This is helpful when you're typing up your status,
but how can you submit that status for the world to see without condescending to
use the mouse to click the Post button?

| Key combination                    | Result                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ctrl + enter | Submit / send post (Facebook, Gmail) |
| alt + enter  | Newline (Excel, Google Spreadsheet)  |

Clicking ctrl + enter when typing a Facebook post submits
that post. It's like telling Facebook
"[This is my final answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI5ijh15OYg&feature=youtu.be&t=17s)". 
This shortcut also works in Gmail to send an email that
you are composing.

![Facebook post](https://i.imgur.com/YG4uNGU.png)

On the flipside, if you're in a field that uses the enter key to
submit the entry (such as Excel cells), you can generally use alt +
enter to create a newline.

### 6/25: Jump to Website Search Box

Have you ever wondered if there is a shortcut that immediately places your
cursor in a website's search box? Probably not, but after learning this shortcut
you'll never risk wondering.

![Twitter search](https://i.imgur.com/xUhbXtO.png)

| Key combination | Result                                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /    | Place cursor in search box (Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.) |

When you are within Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and many other websites
pressing the / (front slash) key will place your cursor in the search
box so that you can search mouse-free. Since the front slash shares the key with
the ? you can remember this shortcut by thinking, "How can I find
what I'm looking for **?**".

### 6/26: Gmail Bullets and Indentation

Numeric and bulleted lists are a clean and concise way to communicate a list of
items, but Gmail hides the options within the formatting bar. Learn these
shortcuts to be a top lister.

| Key combination                                   | Result                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ctrl + shift + 7 | Add numeric list            |
| ctrl + shift + 8 | Add bulleted list           |
| ctrl + ]                    | Indent line or selection    |
| ctrl + [                    | Unindent line or selection  |
| shift + enter               | Add new line without bullet |

![Gmail bulleting](https://i.imgur.com/c4KgJfU.png)

ctrl + shift + 7 will get you started with a
numeric list. If bullets are more your thing than swap the 7 for an
8. ctrl + ] can be used to indent a line, and
ctrl + [ will unident it. Think of the braces as really
flat arrows pointing in the direction you want the list to be indented. If
you've ever wondered how to add a new line between bullets without adding a new
bullet you simply need to add shift to the enter for
[more power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkyLnWm1iCs&feature=youtu.be&t=1m38s).

Learning these shortcuts will help you create bulleted lists both in Gmail and
Google Docs.

### 6/27: Browser Bookmarks

Want to add the current website as a bookmark? There's a shortcut to make that
bookmark star turn yellow.

| Key combination                                   | Result                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + d                    | Add current page to bookmarks (Chrome, Firefox, IE)  |
| ctrl + shift + b | Toggle bookmark bar open/close (Chrome, Firefox, IE) |

To bookmark the current page press ctrl + d (try it now!).
Think **D** as in "**D**oubt I'll remember this website if I don't bookmark it".

If you'd like to see your bookmark bar (or hide it) ctrl +
shift + b is the way to do it.

### 6/28: Slack Channel Selector

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for our company's
internal communications. It's what you would get if AIM and IRC had a much cuter
baby. It provides multiple channels (like chat rooms) to have conversations, but
having to click on the channel you want to view is silly when there is a
shortcut for that.

![Slack logo](https://i.imgur.com/7PpM4MT.jpg =300x)

| Key combination                | Result                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| ctrl + k | Opens channel selection window in Slack |

With ctrl + k you can jump between Slack conversations
without lifting your fingers off of the keyboard.

### 6/29: Chrome Dev Tools

The Chrome Dev Tools is an indispensable tool for web developers, but even
non-developers can use it to get a better understanding of what may be going
wrong with a web page that they are viewing. Here is a list of shortcuts that I
use on a daily basis.

| Key combination                                   | Result                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| F12                                    | Open Chrome Dev Tools (to last used tab) |
| ctrl + shift + j | Open Chrome Dev Tools (to Console tab)   |
| esc                                    | Toggle Console open / closed             |
| ctrl + o                    | Navigate to source file                  |
| ctrl + g                    | Go to line number                        |
| ctrl + b                    | Add breakpoint (when in source file)     |
| F8                                     | Resume from breakpoint while debugging   |
| F10                                    | Step over next function while debugging  |
| F11                                    | Step into next function while debugging  |
| ctrl + l                    | Clear console                            |

The average user may only care to know how to open the Chrome Dev Tools
(F12), which is great, but if you're a web developer you should
commit to memorizing all of these shortcuts to make your working life a little
bit easier.

### 6/30: A Shortcut for Shortcuts

We've covered a lot of shortcuts this month, but there are plenty of others out
there. Perhaps one of the best shortcuts to learn is one that tells you what
other shortcuts are available.

| Key combination | Result                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ?    | Lists the available shortcuts for many website applications (Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.) |

Many of the websites that you use every day provide a list of supported
shortcuts when you press the ? key (outside of an input box). This
single shortcut can make you a shortcut expert in Gmail, Facebook, Twitter,
Google+, and many other websites.

| left-arrow                               | move cursor left                                                                                          |
| ctrl + left-arrow             | move cursor left to the beginning of the word                                                             |

| shift + key combo                        | select text between cursor start and end point                                                            |
| alt + /                       | search the menu within Google Docs                                                                        |
| ctrl + shift + v   | Paste without formatting (Google Docs / Microsoft Word), Select from clipboard (Web Storm, Visual Studio) |
| win + l                       | Lock screen (in Windows)                                                                                  |
| win + d                       | Show desktop (and minimize all windows) in Windows                                                        |
| ctrl + t                      | Create new tab                                                                                            |

**Update:** I recently discovered a much smarter way to be doing this. Here it
is:

[Circle CI](http://circleci.com) is an awesome, affordable continuous
integration solution. I am currently using it in an Angular + Rails project,
scaffolded with Yeoman, following a workflow similar to
[this](http://jeff.konowit.ch/posts/yeoman-rails-angular/).

Here's the problem I ran into: Circle was automatically recognizing and running
my rspec tests, but not my angular app's (located at rails_root/angular) karma
tests.

## Circle.yml

Boom. The npm/bower package management is a little time-consuming, but this runs
both my rspec and karma tests.

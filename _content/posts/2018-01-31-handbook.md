The Base Two Handbook was born on August 26th, 2016. It took another year
and a half to get it to "completion," and now we're ready to share it with the
world. You can [check out the Base Two Handbook here](https://github.com/b2io/handbook).
This post will delve into the reasons behind the project and our process.

## Impetus

As we began what would be considered a "hiring spree" for Base Two (we hired four
people in 2016), it became apparent that we were throwing new hires squarely
into the deep end. Many of our internal processes and cultural expectations were
scattered around in various Google Drive documents, if they were written down at
all.

## Method

### Cultural

Writing can be daunting on its own, writing what essentially represents
company policy doubly so. In order to keep this project on our team's radar, we
scheduled weekly, 1-hour Handbook Work Sessions. These were entirely voluntary,
and were meant mostly as encouragement-via-calendar-reminder to continue on work
that was in process and review work that had been submitted for review. We also
added the Handbook as a topic of conversation in our Weekly Meetings.

### Technological

We started by creating a rough outline of the Handbook sections. This happened
over a couple-hour session of brainstorming in a shared Google Doc. We then
separated each section into its own separate Markdown file and added them to a
repository in GitHub.

We decided to host our Handbook on GitHub because Base Two is currently
comprised entirely of developers who are all comfortable and familiar with using
GitHub to contribute and collaborate on projects. It was important to us that
every member of the team felt comfortable with the process, since we wanted the
Handbook to be an ever-evolving and team-built document. And so, we decided to
organize our Handbook in the same way that we work on projects: a collection
of files (in this case, Markdown) that any member of the team could edit and
submit for reviews.

Of all the features that GitHub offers, the Issues feature was the most
We used the Issues feature to break filling in sections into smaller tasks
that team members could claim and focus on. Once each section was at least
initialized, we added issues for things like typos, broken links, updated
policies.

Any time an issue was completed, it went through GitHub's Pull Request process
before the changes were merged into the Handbook. At this stage, any team member
could review the proposed additions and request changes.

The Base Two Handbook was born on August 26th, 2016. It took another year
and a half to get it to "completion," and now we're ready to share it with the
world. You can [check out the Base Two Handbook here](https://github.com/b2io/handbook).
Read on to delve into the process we used, and how we got here.

## Impetus

As we began what would be considered a "hiring spree" for Base Two (we hired four
people in 2016), it became apparent that we were throwing new hires squarely
into the deep end. Many of our internal processes and cultural expectations were
scattered around in various Google Drive documents, if they were written down at
all.

The original goal for the Handbook was to provide a new employee with helpful
information for their first days and weeks with Base Two. It has also proven to
be helpful to the company overall, prompting us to consider our internal policies
and giving us a structured environment in which to discuss changes. We hope that
by publishing publicly it will also serve as an ambassador for our unique
organization.

## Method

### Cultural

Writing can be daunting on its own, writing what essentially represents
company policy doubly so. In order to keep this project on our team's radar, we
scheduled weekly, 1-hour Handbook Work Sessions. These were entirely voluntary,
and were meant mostly as encouragement-via-calendar-reminder to continue on work
that was in process and review work that had been submitted for review. We also
added the Handbook as a topic of conversation in our Weekly Meetings.

### Technological

We started by creating a rough outline of the Handbook sections. This happened
over a couple-hour session of brainstorming in a shared Google Doc. We then
separated each section into its own separate Markdown file, all of which were
eventually added to a repository in GitHub.

We decided to host our Handbook on GitHub because Base Two is currently
comprised entirely of developers who are all comfortable and familiar with using
GitHub to contribute to and collaborate on projects. It was important to us that
every member of the team felt comfortable with the process, since we wanted the
Handbook to be an ever-evolving and team-built document.

The Issues feature built into GitHub was very helpful for thi project. We used
the it to create small tasks that team members could claim and focus on. Once
each section of the Handbook was at least initialized, we added issues for
things like typos, broken links, updated policies. This process ensured that
nothing was forgotten and also allowed us suggest improvements without feeling
pressured to get them done immediately.

Any time an issue was completed, it went through GitHub's Pull Request process
before the changes were merged into the Handbook. At this stage, any team member
could review the proposed additions and request changes.

If you're doing database seeding in a rails app through `seeds.rb` you might be
interested in this snippet, especially if you're using CSV files to help you do
it.

### Mo Rows, Mo Problems

A couple of our recent projects have had rather large CSV files that need to be
seeded. Running a `rake db:seed` command takes an agonizing couple of minutes
(several of the files have tens of thousands of rows). To help soothe our
neurotic impulses to kill the process midway through we decided to have a bit of
fun sprucing up the console feedback while the seeding is underway.

We started out with a simple `puts "Seeding Models..."`, but that really doesn't
tell you anything about how many more models need to be seeded. We decided to
take a page out of the UNIX playbook and give the user a bit more information.

### The UNIX way

There's a nifty utility named `wget` in UNIX that will let you download things
given a URL. It gives you a nice visual representation of the progress in the
console using a text-based progress bar that looks like this:

```
vagrant@lucid64:~$ wget https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png

```

With a bit of digging, we found the `\r` special character for the `print`
method, which allows you to do some UNIX-style magic in updating what you've
already printed to the console. The `\r` character will clear the current line
of the display in the console.

Running a `rake db:seed` will now give you live progress updates:

```
    vagrant@lucid64:/vagrant$ rake db:seed
    Seeding Genre:
    100.00% [=====================================================================>]
```

Ah, much better!

        <h1>Hello, We&rsquo;re Base Two</h1>

        <p>We design and develop projects for web, mobile, and desktop environments. We work with businesses, big and small, to turn their ideas into beautiful, functional technology.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon icon-code"></span> Web</h2>

                <p>We create rich user experiences and the back-end services to support them. Our expertise in full-stack web development means we can realize your vision from start to finish. Our work includes enterprise software, e-commerce solutions, websites, and web applications. Whether you are looking to start a new project or trying to finish an existing one, we have the chops to get it done.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
                <h2><span class="icon icon-mobile-phone"></span> Mobile</h2>

                <p>The smartphone and tablet market is growing exponentially. Android and iOS dominate the market, but other players are still relevant. So, which mobile operating system are you going to target? We use Phonegap to eliminate that dilemma for you. We write code once and deploy to every major mobile OS. If your end-user has a mobile device, you've got an app for it.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
                <h2><span class="icon icon-pencil"></span> Design</h2>

                <p>We do user-centric, interaction-driven design. We assess your targeted user base and determine the most effective way to structure your content. We iterate using wireframes and click-through prototypes until it works just right, and then we make it look like a million bucks. Need to update your brand? We do that, too.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon icon-lightbulb"></span> Requirements Gathering</h2>

                <p>The first step to solving a problem is understanding it. We put a huge emphasis on understanding our clients&rsquo; work. For us, requirements gathering isn&rsquo;t just a phase at the beginning of the project, it is an ongoing process. We are always working to better understand our clients&rsquo; business needs, and we convert those needs into user stories and project milestones.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon icon-sitemap"></span> UX/UI</h2>

                <p>Great code is useless without great user interface design. Base Two delivers both.</p>

                <p>We start by creating user stories to get a firm understanding of how your average user works and to tease out any hidden interaction requirements. Then we audit your content, optimizing it for web and mobile interfaces and organizing it so your users can navigate intuitively and effectively.</p>

                <p>The resulting Information Architecture forms the foundation for the structure of the project. We use iterative wireframes and rapid prototyping to mock up and then fine-tune the user flow. Once the application flow is just right, we skin the wireframes, producing a beautiful, usable design.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon icon-repeat"></span> Agile Development</h2>

                <p>At Base Two, we manage projects differently. We follow a software development discipline known as the Agile Method, a philosophy acknowledges that requirements and solutions evolve throughout the project lifecycle. With Agile, we divide the project scope into many small milestones with clear, concise goals. The result? Our customers begin receiving deliverables in the first weeks of development, get an earlier return on investment, and are never out of the loop.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon icon-beaker"></span> Test Driven Development</h2>

                <p>
                    <abbr class="initialism" title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> is a software development methodology we use to ensure that our software meets user requirements, and that it continues to meet the requirements as new features are introduced. For each new feature, we write an initially failing test, develop the feature until the test passes, and then refactor the code for optimization and maintenance. With TDD every feature has associated tests explaining exactly how the code should function. Therefore the verification that TDD provides also serves as documentation for the application.

            <h2>Why We Exist</h2>

            <p>Tired of long hours, technological dead-ends, and bureaucratic management we realized that there has to be a better way. Base Two was created to allow us to work on challenging problems, build strong and honest relationships with our clients, and provide a balanced and satisfying work life for us and our employees.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>How We Work</h2>

            <p>We try to create a work environment that allows talented, self-motivated individuals to thrive. Projects are scoped and scheduled by the employees who will be working on them. There are no quotas or deadlines handed down by management. Our office space allows for ideas and passion to be shared, but if your local coffee shop is a better venue for you to get work done then that’s where you should be - the world is your office.</p>

            <p>To ensure that Base Two and its employees are constantly improving we invest 20% of our time toward PQED. Employees are encouraged to spend one day a week on PQED: researching new technologies, authoring blog posts, or working on personal products.</p>

                    <p>By providing a flexible, manageable work schedule with time to work on pet projects and improve professional skills our employees are able to retain their passion for what they do. We believe that this higher quality of life for our employees results in a higher quality of service for our clients.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Once a month the entire company takes a break from client work to focus on a shared effort, whether that is a product idea that an employee dreamed up or a fun development challenge.</p>

            <h2>What We Offer</h2>

            <p>The health and wellbeing of our employees is foundational to our success. To ensure that there is a healthy balance between life and work we offer the following benefits:</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
                    <h3><span class="icon icon-lightbulb"></span> Free Health Insurance</h3>

                    <p>Health insurance is expensive, and throughout the industry employees are being asked to contribute more. That’s not something that our employees worry about. We provide each of our employees with health and dental insurance 100% free.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
                    <h3><span class="icon icon-lightbulb"></span> 401k</h3>

                    <p>We want our employees to invest in their retirement, and to encourage that we match contributions up to 3%. When we say that we match - we mean immediately - not in a few years. Our employees are always 100% vested (it is their money afterall).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
                    <h3><span class="icon icon-lightbulb"></span> Time Off</h3>

                    <p>There is more to life than work, and we want to make sure that our employees experience it. We recognize all of the Federal holidays plus a few extra for good measure (Earth Day and Base Two Day) - for a total of 12 company days off.</p>
                    <p>Each employee also receives 15 vacation days a year. We know that being sick is no vacation, and it shouldn’t come out of that vacation time. If you’re sick then take the time necessary to get healthy.</p>
